<h3>Create a new show</h3>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Please ensure you're familiar with our
    <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_userguidelines') }}">User Guidelines</a>
    and <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_faq') }}#suitability">Show Suitability Guidelines</a> first.</p>

    <p>Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*). You can change any field later, with the
    possible exception of Society: please contact us to change it later if neccessary.
    Once the show is created you'll be able to add a
    publicity image (please ensure you have permission to use it!).</p>

    <p>Write a Description with the general public in mind â€“ what is this show and why
    should somebody come to see it? You can add auditions and production team vacancies
    separately once the show is created; they don't need to be mentioned here.</p>

    {% if not is_granted('APPROVE', form.vars.data) %}
        <p>When you click 'Create', this information will be sent to moderators,
        who will have to review and approve it before it appears on Camdram.
        If you enter a society or venue that is registered on Camdram, they will
        be responsible for show approval; if not, Camdram's volunteer website
        admins will do this. Please allow time for this step.
