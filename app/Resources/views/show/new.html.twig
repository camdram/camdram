<h3>Create a new show</h3>

<div class="panel">
    <p> Please ensure you're familiar with our
        <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_userguidelines') }}">User
        Guidelines</a> and
        <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_faq') }}#suitability">Show
        Suitability Guidelines</a> first.
    </p>

    <p> Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*). You can change any field
        later, except possibly Societies: contact us for help with that.
        You don't need to enter things like "Unknown" or "TBC".
        Publicity images, audition adverts and production team vacancies can be added
        after the show is created.
