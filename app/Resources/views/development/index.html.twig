<p>
Camdram is an <a href="http://opensource.org/docs/osd" target="_blank" rel="ext">open-source</a> project developed by a team of volunteers
for the benefit of the Cambridge student theatre community. We use our
<a href="https://github.com/camdram/camdram" target="_blank" rel="ext">project page</a> on
<a href="https://github.com/about" target="_blank" rel="ext">GitHub</a> to co-ordinate our work and host a copy of the code that runs this site,
as well details about bugs that have been submitted and our future roadmap for the site.
</p>

<p>
If you don't have programming skills but think you've found a bug, or you just have a cool idea for a new feature on Camdram, you can still
<a href="https://github.com/camdram/camdram/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="ext">create a new issue</a> on GitHub, and one of our developers
will get back to you.
</p>

<p>
If you're a programmer and would like to contribute to Camdram, we invite you to
<a href="https://github.com/camdram/camdram/fork" target="_blank" rel="ext">fork our repository</a>. You can then fix any
<a href="https://github.com/camdram/camdram/issues?state=open" target="_blank" rel="ext">open issue</a> or create a new one. Once you've fixed a
bug or created some new functionality, you can then submit a pull request to be reviewed by the development team.
</p>

<p>
In order to avoid wasting effort, we recommend you discuss your ideas before carrying out any significant development work. If there's a relevant
issue then you can use that, otherwise we have a <a href="https://gitter.im/camdram/development" target="_blank">Gitter chatroom</a> for
developer discussions and questions - feel free to send a message there. You can also use this group if you're having problems getting your
development environment set up, or if you're not sure whether something is a bug or a problem with your set-up. We run Camdram as a meritocracy:
anyone who has a reasonable number of pull requests accepted will be given access rights to commit straight to the Camdram repository.
