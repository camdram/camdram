<h2 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This page describes what data this website collects about you.
The general rule is that we try not to be evil;
camdram.net does store and log personal information if you create an
account with us, but we do not disclose it to anyone without good reason.
If you have any questions, please contact
<a href="mailto:support@camdram.net?Subject=Privacy%20policy" target="_top">support@camdram.net</a>.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Our web server collects the domain name and IP address of the
    host from which you access the internet, the browser software you use
    and your operating system, the date and time you access each page, and
    the domain name of the site which linked to camdram.net.

    <li>This data is used to determine the number of visitors to different
    sections of our site, and to create statistics about what browser or
    operating system they use. We do not use it to track or record personal
    information. The raw data is not disclosed to anyone outside the
    camdram.net administrative team, with the exception of Google, our analytics
    providerâ€”see below. Anonymised statistics may be made publicly available.

    <li>When you create an account on camdram.net, you may provide
    optional personal information about yourself. This information is used
    to obtain anonymous statistics about the users of our site, and to
    contact you if you are a society administrator with questions we may
    have about your society's shows. The raw data is not disclosed to anyone
    outside the camdram.net administrative team. Anonymised statistics may
    be made publically available.

    <li>In the event of technical issues with the website, error messages are
    sent to Sentry (<a href="https://sentry.io" target="_blank">https://sentry.io</a>), to
    enable us to identify and resolve problems as quickly as possible. If you
    are logged in at the time, your email address is included.

    <li>If you identify yourself by logging in to camdram.net, we log any
    administrative actions you take on the website. This is used for
    debugging and security purposes. This information is not disclosed to
    anyone outside the camdram.net administrative team.

    <li>The email address you register to your account may be visible to other
    relevant users in some scenarios. For example, when a email is sent to a
    society's admins, it is sent with recipients visible to each other for clarity.

    <li>We will provide any information to authorities if required to by law.
