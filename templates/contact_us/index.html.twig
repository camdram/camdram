<h2>Contact Us</h2>

<p>Camdram is run solely by volunteers. We are here to help, but it's not always possible for us to respond
    rapidly. Please check our <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_faq') }}">frequently asked questions</a> (FAQ)
    page before contacting us.
</p>

<p>We continuously monitor Camdram so if you got an error message, chances are that we already know! However
    if you've found something that isn't working right, please create an 'issue' on our
    <a href="http://github.com/camdram/camdram/issues" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page (external website).
    You will automatically receive email notifications when someone is working on the issue and when it is fixed.
    See <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_development') }}">here</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>Please only use the form on this page to contact us with queries or problems
    that relate specifically to Camdram as a web site. We operate as a platform
    service that anyone can use and typically have little if any contact with our
    users. A large variety of people, societies, venues and organisation list their
    shows and vacancies on Camdram and it would be impractical for us to keep
    abreast of everything that goes on. If you have a query regarding a specific
    show, a particular venue or a given funding society then it would be better
    addressed to that body rather than us. It therefore follows that we are poorly
    placed to answer ticketing questions or to offer generic advice on getting
    involved with theatre in Cambridge.
</p>

<p>For anything else, if the FAQ page didn't help, please fill in the form below and we'll get back to you as
    soon as we can. Alternatively, you can email <a href="mailto:support@camdram.net">support@camdram.net</a>.
