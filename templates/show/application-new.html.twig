<h3>Add Director/Producer Advert</h3>

<div class="panel">
    <p>
        Use the form below to create an advert for core production team positions for your show,
        e.g. directors, producers, musical directors and choreographers. The advert will be displayed
        until the deadline date.
    </p>
    <p>
        Advertisements for other positions (e.g. musicians) are advised to create either a technical
        team advert or audition using the link above for now (we have plans to overhaul the vacancies
        system eventually).
    </p>
    <p>
        The CUADC Directors' and Producers' Reps aim to send out the Production mailing list with all
        the current directing and producing adverts on Camdram once a week during Full Term. For more
        information they can be contacted on <a href="mailto:director@cuadc.org">director@cuadc.org</a>
        and <a href="mailto:producer@cuadc.org">producer@cuadc.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>{{ include('markdown_notice.html.twig', { thing: 'advert' }) }}</p>
    <p>
        If you wish to include a contact, please ensure you have that team member's permission
        <em>before</em> adding their details to the advert!
