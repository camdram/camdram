    <p>
        The Camdram API allows anyone to create their own applications which read and write
        the data on Camdram using a REST-based API. Data currently supported includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shows</li>
        <li>Venues</li>
        <li>Societies</li>
        <li>People</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In order to make write requests you must create an API key. API keys can be associated with a user, or
        a society/venue for which you are an administrator. If your app only performs read-only actions, you
        are still advised to create an API key so that we can better monitor how the API is used. Additionally,
        non authenticated API requests are subjected to a lower rate limit.

        There is some basic documentation available on our sister site <a href="https://camdram.github.io/api">
        Camdram Updates</a>. We also have a <a href="https://lists.srcf.net/mailman/listinfo/camdram-api-users">
        mailing list</a> which we strongly advise all consumers of our API subscribe to. Currently this requires
        Raven access in order to access the Mailman interface, however please contact us if you do not have a
        Raven account and wish to subscribed manually by a member of the Camdram team.
    </p>
    <p>
        The API uses the same URL structure as Camdram itself - if you're not what the URL is, try simply
        adding '.json' or '.xml' to the URL for a relevant page.
