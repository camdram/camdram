    George Orson Welles was an American actor, director, writer and producer who worked
    extensively in theater, radio and film. He is best remembered for his innovative
    work in all three media, most notably Caesar, a groundbreaking Broadway adaption
    of Julius Caesar and the debut of the Mercury Theatre; The War of the Worlds,
    one of the most famous broadcasts in the history of radio; and Citizen Kane, which
    is consistently ranked as one of the all-time greatest films.

    After directing a number of high-profile productions in his early twenties, including
    an innovative adaptation of Macbeth and The Cradle Will Rock, Welles found national
    and international fame as the director and narrator of a 1938 radio adaptation
    of H. G. Wells' novel The War of the Worlds performed for the radio drama anthology
    series Mercury Theatre on the Air. It was reported to have caused widespread panic
    when listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was occurring.
    Although these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated, they rocketed
    Welles to instant notoriety.

    His first film was Citizen Kane, which he co-wrote, produced, directed, and starred
    in as Charles Foster Kane. Welles was always an outsider to the studio system
    and directed only 13 full-length films in his career. While he struggled for creative
    control in the face of studios, many of his films were heavily edited and others
    were left unreleased. His distinctive directorial style featured layered and nonlinear
    narrative forms, innovative uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro, unusual camera
    angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots, and long takes.
    He has been praised as a major creative force and as "the ultimate auteur." Welles
    followed up Citizen Kane with other critically acclaimed films, including The
    Magnificent Ambersons in 1942, and Touch of Evil in 1958.

    Katharine Houghton Hepburn was an American actress of film, stage, and television.
    Known for her headstrong independence and spirited personality, Hepburn's career
    as a Hollywood leading lady spanned more than 60 years. Her work came in a range
    of genres, from screwball comedy to literary drama, and she received four Academy
    Awards for Best Actress—a record for any performer. Hepburn's characters were
    often strong, sophisticated women with a hidden vulnerability.

    Raised in Connecticut by wealthy, progressive parents, Hepburn began to act while
    studying at Bryn Mawr College. After four years in the theatre, favorable reviews
    of her work on Broadway brought her to the attention of Hollywood. Her early years
    in the film industry were marked with success, including an Academy Award for
    her third picture, Morning Glory, but this was followed by a series of commercial
    failures. In 1938 she was labeled "box office poison". Hepburn masterminded her

    be the star. In the 1940s she was contracted to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where her

    Humphrey DeForest Bogart was an American actor and is widely regarded as an American
    cultural icon. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Bogart as the greatest
    male star in the history of American cinema.

    After trying various jobs, Bogart began acting in 1921 and became a regular in
    Broadway productions in the 1920s and 1930s. When the stock market crash of 1929
    reduced the demand for plays, Bogart turned to film. His first great success was
    as Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest, and this led to a period of typecasting
    as a gangster with films such as Angels with Dirty Faces and B-movies like The
    Return of Doctor X.

    Bogart's breakthrough as a leading man came in 1941, with High Sierra and The
    Maltese Falcon. The next year, his performance in Casablanca raised him to the
    peak of his profession and, at the same time, cemented his trademark film persona,
    that of the hard-boiled cynic who ultimately shows his noble side. Other successes
    followed, including To Have and Have Not; The Big Sleep; Dark Passage and Key
    Largo, with his wife Lauren Bacall; The Treasure of the Sierra Madre; In a Lonely
    Place; The African Queen, for which he won his only Academy Award; Sabrina; and
    The Caine Mutiny. His last movie was The Harder They Fall. During a film career

    Ruth Elizabeth "Bette" Davis was an American actress of film, television and theater.
    Noted for her willingness to play unsympathetic characters, she was highly regarded
    for her performances in a range of film genres, from contemporary crime melodramas
    to historical and period films and occasional comedies, although her greatest
    successes were her roles in romantic dramas.

    After appearing in Broadway plays, Davis moved to Hollywood in 1930, but her early
    films for Universal Studios were unsuccessful. She joined Warner Bros. in 1932
    and established her career with several critically acclaimed performances. In
    1937, she attempted to free herself from her contract and although she lost a
    well-publicized legal case, it marked the beginning of the most successful period
    of her career. Until the late 1940s, she was one of American cinema's most celebrated
    leading ladies, known for her forceful and intense style. Davis gained a reputation
    as a perfectionist who could be highly combative, and confrontations with studio
    executives, film directors and costars were often reported. Her forthright manner,
    clipped vocal style and ubiquitous cigarette contributed to a public persona which
    has often been imitated and satirized.

    Jayne Mansfield was an American actress in film, theatre, and television, a nightclub
    entertainer, a singer, and one of the early Playboy Playmates. She was a major
    Hollywood sex symbol of the 1950s and early 1960s. Mansfield was 20th Century
    Fox's alternative Marilyn Monroe and came to be known as the Working Man's Monroe.

    against her over-publicity, she became a box-office has-been by the early 1960s.

    While Mansfield's film career was short-lived, she had several box office successes
    and won a Theatre World Award and a Golden Globe. She enjoyed success in the role
    of fictional actress Rita Marlowe in both the 1955–1956 Broadway version, and,
    in the 1957 Hollywood film version of Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?. She showcased
    her comedic skills in The Girl Can't Help It, her dramatic assets in The Wayward
    Bus, and her sizzling presence in Too Hot to Handle. She also sang for studio
    recordings, including the album Shakespeare, Tchaikovsky & Me and the single As
    the Clouds Drift By. Mansfield's notable television work included television dramas
    Follow the Sun and Burke's Law, game shows The Match Game and What's My Line?,
    variety shows The Jack Benny Program and The Bob Hope Show, the The Ed Sullivan
    Show, and a large number of talk shows.

    William H. Seward in a bid to help the Confederacy's cause. Although Robert E.
    Lee's Army of Northern Virginia had surrendered four days earlier, Booth believed
    the American Civil War was not yet over because Confederate General Joseph E.
    Johnston's army was still fighting the Union Army. Of the conspirators, only Booth
    was completely successful in carrying out his respective part of the plot. After
    Booth shot him once in the back of the head, Lincoln died the next morning. Seward
