    Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written early in the career of William Shakespeare
    about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding
    families. It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and,
    along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed plays. Today, the title
    characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers.

    Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to
    antiquity. Its plot is based on an Italian tale, translated into verse as The
    Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose
    in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567. Shakespeare borrowed heavily
    from both but, to expand the plot, developed supporting characters, particularly
    Mercutio and Paris. Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, the play
    was first published in a quarto version in 1597. This text was of poor quality,
    and later editions corrected it, bringing it more in line with Shakespeare's original.

    Shakespeare's use of his poetic dramatic structure, especially effects such as
    switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension, his expansion of minor
    characters, and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story, has been praised
    as an early sign of his dramatic skill. The play ascribes different poetic forms
    to different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops.
    Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the sonnet over the course of the play.

    The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is a tragedy by William Shakespeare.
    Set in the Kingdom of Denmark, the play dramatizes the revenge Prince Hamlet exacts
    on his uncle Claudius for murdering King Hamlet, Claudius's brother and Prince
    Hamlet's father, and then succeeding to the throne and taking as his wife Gertrude,
    the old king's widow and Prince Hamlet's mother. The play vividly portrays both
    true and feigned madness – from overwhelming grief to seething rage – and explores
    themes of treachery, revenge, incest, and moral corruption.

    Hamlet is Shakespeare's longest play and among the most powerful and influential
    tragedies in English literature, with a story capable of "seemingly endless retelling
    and adaptation by others." The play was one of Shakespeare's most popular works
    during his lifetime and still ranks among his most-performed, topping the Royal
    Shakespeare Company's performance list since 1879. It has inspired writers from
    Goethe and Dickens to Joyce and Murdoch, and has been described as "the world's
    most filmed story after Cinderella".

    Shakespeare based Hamlet on the legend of Amleth, preserved by 13th-century chronicler
    Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum as subsequently retold by 16th-century scholar
    François de Belleforest. He may also have drawn on or perhaps written an earlier
    Elizabethan play known today as the Ur-Hamlet. He almost certainly created the
    title role for Richard Burbage, the leading tragedian of Shakespeare's time. In
    the 400 years since, the role has been performed by highly acclaimed actors and
    actresses from each successive age.

    Macbeth is a play written by William Shakespeare. It is considered one of his
    darkest and most powerful tragedies. Set in Scotland, the play dramatizes the
    corrosive psychological and political effects produced when its protagonist, the
    Scottish lord Macbeth, chooses evil as the way to fulfill his ambition for power.
    He commits regicide to become king and then furthers his moral descent with a
    reign of murderous terror to stay in power, eventually plunging the country into
    civil war. In the end, he loses everything that gives meaning and purpose to his
    life, before losing his life itself.

    The play is believed to have been written between 1603 and 1607, and is most commonly
    dated 1606. The earliest account of a performance of what was probably Shakespeare's
    play is April 1611, when Simon Forman recorded seeing such a play at the Globe
    Theatre. It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book.
    It was most likely written during the reign of James I, who had been James VI
    of Scotland before he succeeded to the English throne in 1603. James was a patron
    of Shakespeare’s acting company, and of all the plays Shakespeare wrote during
    James’s reign, Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright’s relationship with
    the sovereign.

    West Side Story is an American musical with a book by Arthur Laurents, music by
    Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and conception and choreography
    by Jerome Robbins. It was inspired by William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet.

    The story is set in the East 40s and West 50s of the Upper West Side neighborhood
    in New York City in the mid-1950s, an ethnic, blue-collar neighborhood. The musical
    explores the rivalry between the Jets and the Sharks, two teenage street gangs
    of different ethnic backgrounds. The members of the Sharks from Puerto Rico are
    taunted by the Jets, a Polish-American working-class group. The young protagonist,
    Tony, one of the Jets, falls in love with Maria, the sister of Bernardo, the leader
    of the Sharks. The dark theme, sophisticated music, extended dance scenes, and
    focus on social problems marked a turning point in American musical theatre. Bernstein's
    score for the musical includes "Something's Coming", "Maria", "America", "Somewhere",
    "Tonight", "Jet Song", "I Feel Pretty", "A Boy Like That", "One Hand, One Heart",
    "Gee, Officer Krupke", and "Cool".

    Wicked is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and a book by Winnie
    Holzman. It is based on the 1995 Gregory Maguire novel Wicked: The Life and Times
    of the Wicked Witch of the West, a parallel novel of the 1939 film The Wizard
    of Oz and L. Frank Baum's classic story The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The musical
    is told from the perspective of the witches of the Land of Oz; its plot begins
    before and continues after Dorothy's arrival in Oz from Kansas and includes several
    references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel. Wicked tells the story of two unlikely
    friends, Elphaba and Glinda, who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints,
    rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the Wizard's corrupt government,
    and, ultimately, Elphaba's public fall from grace.

    Produced by Universal Pictures in coalition with Marc Platt and David Stone, the
    Joe Mantello–directed and Wayne Cilento–choreographed original production of Wicked
    premiered on Broadway at the Gershwin Theatre in October 2003, after completing
    pre-Broadway SHN tryouts at San Francisco's Curran Theatre in May 2003. Its original
    stars included Idina Menzel as Elphaba, Kristin Chenoweth as Glinda, and Joel
    Grey as the Wizard. The original Broadway production won three Tony Awards and
    six Drama Desk Awards whilst its cast album received a Grammy Award. It has since
    celebrated its ninth anniversary on October 30, 2012, and played for 3,886 performances,
    making Wicked the 12th longest-running Broadway show in history.

    Jesus Christ Superstar is a rock opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber with lyrics by Tim
    Rice. The musical started as a rock opera concept recording before its first staging
    on Broadway in 1971. The musical is based very loosely on the Gospels' accounts
    of the last week of Jesus' life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival
    of Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion. It highlights
    political and interpersonal struggles between Judas Iscariot and Jesus, struggles
    that are not in the Bible. The resurrection is not included. It therefore largely
    follows the form of a traditional passion play.

    The work's depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and
    the other characters. A large part of the plot focuses on the character of Judas,
    who is depicted as a tragic figure dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus
    steers his disciples. Contemporary attitudes and sensibilities as well as slang
    pervade the lyrics and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout
    the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly feature
    many intentional anachronisms.

    The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice is a tragedy by William Shakespeare,
    believed to have been written in approximately 1603, and based on the Italian
    short story Un Capitano Moro by Cinthio, a disciple of Boccaccio, first published
    in 1565. The work revolves around four central characters: Othello, a Moorish
    general in the Venetian army; his wife, Desdemona; his lieutenant, Cassio; and
    his trusted ensign, Iago. Because of its varied and current themes of racism,
    love, jealousy, and betrayal, Othello is still often performed in professional
    and community theatres alike and has been the basis for numerous operatic, film,
    and literary adaptations.

    The Phantom of the Opera is a musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics
    by Charles Hart with additions from Richard Stilgoe. Lloyd Webber and Stilgoe
    also wrote the musical's book together. Based on the French novel Le Fantôme de
    l'Opéra by Gaston Leroux, its central plot revolves around a beautiful soprano,
    Christine Daaé, who becomes the obsession of a mysterious, disfigured musical
    genius.

    The musical opened in London's West End in 1986, and on Broadway in 1988. It won
    the 1986 Olivier Award and the 1988 Tony Award for Best Musical, and Michael Crawford
    won the Olivier and Tony Awards for Best Actor in a Musical. It is the longest
    running show in Broadway history by a wide margin, and celebrated its 10,000th
    Broadway performance on 11 February 2012, the first production ever to do so.
    It is the second longest-running West End musical, and the third longest-running
    West End show overall.

    With total estimated worldwide gross receipts of over $5.6 billion and total Broadway
    gross of US $845 million Phantom is the most financially successful entertainment
    event to date. By 2011 it had been seen by over 130 million people in 145 cities
    in 27 countries, and continues to play in both London and New York.

    Grease is a 1971 musical by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. The musical is named
    for the 1950s United States working-class youth subculture known as greasers.
    The musical, set in 1959 at fictional Rydell High School, follows ten working-class
    teenagers as they navigate the complexities of love. The score attempts to recreate
    the sounds of early rock and roll. In its record-breaking original Broadway production,
    Grease was a raunchy, raw, aggressive, vulgar show. Subsequent productions sanitized
    it and tamed it down. The show tackles such social issues as teenage pregnancy
    and gang violence; its themes include love, friendship, teenage rebellion, sexual
    exploration during adolescence, and, to some extent, class consciousness/class
    conflict.

    Grease was first performed in 1971 in the original Kingston Mines Theatre in Chicago,
    located in an old trolley barn. From there, it has been successful on both stage
    and screen, but the content has changed drastically and its teenage characters
    have become less Chicago habitués and more generic. At the time that it closed
    in 1980, Grease's 3,388-performance run was the longest yet in Broadway history,
    although it was surpassed by A Chorus Line a few years later. It went on to become
    a West End hit, a hugely successful film, two popular Broadway revivals in 1994
    and 2007, and a staple of regional theatre, summer stock, community theatre, and
    high school and middle school drama groups. It remains Broadway's fourteenth longest-running
    show.

    of the Duke of Athens, Theseus, and Hippolyta. These include the adventures of
    four young Athenian lovers and a group of six amateur actors, who are controlled
    and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the play
    is set. The play, categorized as a Comedy, is one of Shakespeare's most popular
    works for the stage and is widely performed across the world.

    The Sound of Music is a musical with music by Richard Rodgers, lyrics by Oscar
    Hammerstein II and a book by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse. It is based on
    the memoir of Maria von Trapp, The Story of the Trapp Family Singers. Many songs
    from the musical have become standards, such as "Edelweiss", "My Favorite Things",
    "Climb Ev'ry Mountain", "Do-Re-Mi", and the title song "The Sound of Music".

    The original Broadway production, starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel, opened
    on November 16, 1959; the show has enjoyed numerous productions and revivals since
    then. It was adapted as a 1965 film musical starring Julie Andrews and Christopher
    Plummer, which won five Academy Awards. The Sound of Music was the final musical
    written by Rodgers and Hammerstein; Hammerstein died of cancer nine months after
    the Broadway premiere.

    The Tempest is a play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in
    1610–11, and thought by many critics to be the last play that Shakespeare wrote
    alone. It is set on a remote island, where Prospero, the rightful Duke of Milan,
    plots to restore his daughter Miranda to her rightful place using illusion and
    skillful manipulation. He conjures up a storm, the eponymous tempest, to lure
    his usurping brother Antonio and the complicit King Alonso of Naples to the island.
    There, his machinations bring about the revelation of Antonio's lowly nature,
    the redemption of the King, and the marriage of Miranda to Alonso's son, Ferdinand.

    There is no obvious single source for the plot of The Tempest, but researchers
    have seen parallels in Erasmus's Naufragium, Peter Martyr's De orbe novo, and
    an eyewitness report by William Strachey of the real-life shipwreck of the Sea
    Venture on the islands of Bermuda. In addition, one of Gonzalo's speeches is derived
    from Montaigne's essay Of the Canibales, and much of Prospero's renunciative speech
    is taken word for word from a speech by Medea in Ovid's poem Metamorphoses. The
    masque in Act 4 may have been a later addition, possibly in honour of the wedding
    of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V in 1613. The play was first published in
    the First Folio of 1623.

    Cats is a musical composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber, based on Old Possum's Book
    of Practical Cats by T. S. Eliot. The musical tells the story of a tribe of cats
    called the Jellicles and the night they make what is known as "the Jellicle choice"
    and decide which cat will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new
    life. Cats also introduced the song standard "Memory".

    Directed by Trevor Nunn and choreographed by Gillian Lynne, Cats first opened
    in the West End in 1981 and then with the same creative team on Broadway in 1982.
    It won numerous awards, including Best Musical at both the Laurence Olivier Awards
    and the Tony Awards. The London production ran for twenty-one years and the Broadway
    production ran for eighteen years, both setting . Actresses Elaine Paige and Betty
    Buckley became particularly associated with the musical. One actress, Marlene
    Danielle, performed in the Broadway production for its entire run.

    Cats is the second longest-running show in Broadway history, and the fourth longest-running
    West End musical. It has been performed around the world many times and has been
    translated into more than 20 languages. In 1998, Cats was turned into a made-for-television
    film.

    The Merchant of Venice is a play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been
    written between 1596 and 1598. Though classified as a comedy in the First Folio
    and sharing certain aspects with Shakespeare's other romantic comedies, the play
    is perhaps most remembered for its dramatic scenes, and is best known for Shylock
    and the famous "Hath not a Jew eyes?" speech. Also notable is Portia's speech
    about "the quality of mercy".

    The title character is the merchant Antonio, not the Jewish moneylender Shylock,
    who is the play's most prominent and most famous character. This is made explicit
    by the title page of the first quarto: The most excellent History of the Merchant
    of Venice. With the extreme cruelty of Shylock the Jew towards the Merchant....

    Henry Higgins, a phoneticist, so that she may pass as a well-born lady.

    The musical's 1956 Broadway production was a hit, setting what was then the record
    for the longest run of any major musical theatre production in history. It was
    followed by a hit London production, a popular film version, and numerous revivals.
    It has been called "the perfect musical".

    King Lear is a tragedy by William Shakespeare. The title character descends into
    madness after disposing of his estate between two of his three daughters based
    on their flattery, bringing tragic consequences for all. The play is based on
    the legend of Leir of Britain, a mythological pre-Roman Celtic king. It has been
    widely adapted for the stage and motion pictures, and the role of Lear has been
    coveted and played by many of the world's most accomplished actors.

    The play was written between 1603 and 1606 and later revised. Shakespeare's earlier
    version, The True Chronicle of the History of the Life and Death of King Lear
    and His Three Daughters, was published in quarto in 1608. The Tragedy of King
    Lear, a more theatrical version, was included in the 1623 First Folio. Modern
    editors usually conflate the two, though some insist that each version has its
    individual integrity that should be preserved.

    After the Restoration, the play was often revised with a happy ending for audiences
    who disliked its dark and depressing tone, but since the 19th century Shakespeare's
    original version has been regarded as one of his supreme achievements. The tragedy
    is particularly noted for its probing observations on the nature of human suffering
    and kinship. George Bernard Shaw wrote, "No man will ever write a better tragedy
    than Lear".

    Waiting for Godot is an absurdist play by Samuel Beckett, in which two characters,
    Vladimir and Estragon, wait endlessly and in vain for the arrival of someone named
    Godot. Godot's absence, as well as numerous other aspects of the play, have led
    to many different interpretations since the play's 1953 premiere. It was voted
    "the most significant English language play of the 20th century". Waiting for
    Godot is Beckett's translation of his own original French version, En attendant
    Godot, and is subtitled "a tragicomedy in two acts". The original French text
    was composed between 9 October 1948 and 29 January 1949. The première was on 5
    January 1953 in the Théâtre de Babylone, Paris. The production was directed by
    Roger Blin, who also played the role of Pozzo.

    Mamma Mia! is a stage musical written by British playwright Catherine Johnson,
    based on the songs of ABBA, composed by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, former
    members of the band. The title of the musical is taken from the group's 1975 chart-topper
    "Mamma Mia". Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, who composed the original music
    for ABBA, were involved in the development of the show from the beginning. Anni-Frid
    Lyngstad has been involved financially in the production and she has also been
    present at many of the premieres around the world.

    The musical includes such hits as "Super Trouper", "Lay All Your Love on Me",
    "Dancing Queen", "Knowing Me, Knowing You", "Take a Chance on Me", "Thank You

    The Taming of the Shrew is a comedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been
    written between 1590 and 1592.

    The play begins with a framing device, often referred to as the Induction, in
    which a mischievous nobleman tricks a drunken tinker named Sly into believing
    he is actually a nobleman himself. The nobleman then has the play performed for
    Sly's diversion.

    The main plot depicts the courtship of Petruchio, a gentleman of Verona, and Katherina,
    the headstrong, obdurate shrew. Initially, Katherina is an unwilling participant
    in the relationship, but Petruchio tempers her with various psychological torments—the
    "taming"—until she becomes a compliant and obedient bride. The subplot features
    a competition between the suitors of Katherina's more desirable sister, Bianca.

    The play's apparent misogynistic elements have become the subject of considerable
    controversy, particularly among modern audiences and readers. It has been adapted
    numerous times for stage, screen, opera, and musical theatre; perhaps the most
    famous adaptations being Cole Porter's musical Kiss Me, Kate and the 1967 film
    version of the original play, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. The
    film 10 Things I Hate About You is also loosely based on the play.

    Much Ado About Nothing is a comedic play by William Shakespeare thought to have
    been written in 1598 and 1599, as Shakespeare was approaching the middle of his
    career. The play was included in the First Folio, published in 1623. Much Ado
    About Nothing is generally considered one of Shakespeare’s best comedies, because
    it combines elements of robust hilarity with more serious meditations on honor,
    shame, and court politics. Like As You Like It and Twelfth Night, Much Ado About
    Nothing, though interspersed with darker concerns, is a joyful comedy that ends
    with multiple marriages and no deaths.

    Much Ado About Nothing chronicles two pairs of lovers: Benedick and Beatrice,
    and Claudio and Hero. Benedick and Beatrice are engaged in a very "merry war";
    they are both very witty and proclaim their disdain of love. In contrast, Claudio
    and Hero are sweet young people who are rendered practically speechless by their
    love for one another. Although the young lovers Hero and Claudio provide the main
    impetus for the plot, the courtship between the wittier, wiser lovers Benedick
    and Beatrice is what makes Much Ado About Nothing so memorable. Benedick and Beatrice
    argue with delightful wit, and Shakespeare develops their journey from antagonism
    to sincere love and affection with a rich sense of humor and compassion.

    Fiddler on the Roof is a musical with music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick,
    and book by Joseph Stein, set in Tsarist Russia in 1905. It is based on Tevye
    and his Daughters by Sholem Aleichem. The story centers on Tevye, the father of
    five daughters, and his attempts to maintain his family and Jewish religious traditions
    while outside influences encroach upon their lives. He must cope both with the
    strong-willed actions of his three older daughters—each one's choice of husband
    moves further away from the customs of his faith—and with the edict of the Tsar
    that evicts the Jews from their village.

    The original Broadway production of the show, which opened in 1964, had the first
    musical theatre run in history to surpass 3,000 performances. Fiddler held the
    record for the longest-running Broadway musical for almost 10 years until Grease
    surpassed its run. It remains Broadway's fifteenth longest-running show in history.
    The production was extraordinarily profitable and highly acclaimed. It was nominated
    for ten Tony Awards, winning nine, including Best Musical, score, book, direction
    and choreography. It spawned four Broadway revivals, a successful 1971 film adaptation,
    and the show has enjoyed enduring international popularity. It is also a very
    popular choice for school and community productions.

    Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical is a rock musical with a book and
    lyrics by James Rado and Gerome Ragni and music by Galt MacDermot. A product of
    the hippie counter-culture and sexual revolution of the 1960s, several of its
    songs became anthems of the anti-Vietnam War peace movement. The musical's profanity,
    its depiction of the use of illegal drugs, its treatment of sexuality, its irreverence
    for the American flag, and its nude scene caused much comment and controversy.
    The musical broke new ground in musical theatre by defining the genre of "rock
    musical", using a racially integrated cast, and inviting the audience onstage
    for a "Be-In" finale.

    Hair tells the story of the "tribe", a group of politically active, long-haired
    hippies of the "Age of Aquarius" living a bohemian life in New York City and fighting
    against conscription into the Vietnam War. Claude, his good friend Berger, their
    roommate Sheila and their friends struggle to balance their young lives, loves
    and the sexual revolution with their rebellion against the war and their conservative
    parents and society. Ultimately, Claude must decide whether to resist the draft
    as his friends have done, or to succumb to the pressures of his parents to serve
    in Vietnam, compromising his pacifistic principles and risking his life.

    Twelfth Night; or, What You Will is a comedy by William Shakespeare, believed
    to have been written around 1601–02 as a Twelfth Night's entertainment for the
    close of the Christmas season. The play expanded on the musical interludes and
    riotous disorder expected of the occasion, with plot elements drawn from the short
    story "Of Apollonius and Silla" by Barnabe Rich, based on a story by Matteo Bandello.
    The first recorded performance was on 2 February 1602, at Candlemas, the formal
    end of Christmastide in the year's calendar. The play was not published until
    its inclusion in the 1623 First Folio.

    The Book of Mormon is a religious satire musical with book, lyrics, and music
    by Trey Parker, Robert Lopez, and Matt Stone. Best known for creating the animated
    comedy South Park, Parker and Stone co-created the music with Lopez, a co-composer/co-lyricist
    of Avenue Q. The show lampoons organized religion and traditional musical theatre,
    reflecting the creators' lifelong fascination with Mormonism and musicals.

    The Book of Mormon tells the story of two young Mormon missionaries sent to a
    remote village in northern Uganda, where a brutal warlord is threatening the local
    population. Naïve and optimistic, the two missionaries try to share the Book of
    Mormon, one of their scriptures—which only one of them has read—but have trouble
    connecting with the locals, who are more worried about war, famine, poverty, and
    AIDS than about religion.

    After nearly seven years of development, the show opened on Broadway in March
    2011. The Book of Mormon has garnered overwhelmingly positive critical response
    and numerous theatre awards including nine Tony Awards, one of which was for Best
    Musical, and the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. An original Broadway
    cast recording was released in May 2011 and became the highest-charting Broadway
    cast album in over four decades, reaching No. 3 on the Billboard charts.

    Guys and Dolls is a musical with music and lyrics by Frank Loesser and book by
    Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows. It is based on "The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown" and
    "Blood Pressure" – two short stories by Damon Runyon, – and also borrows characters
    and plot elements from other Runyon stories – most notably "Pick the Winner".

    The premiere on Broadway was in 1950. It ran for 1200 performances and won the
    Tony Award for Best Musical. The musical has had several Broadway and London revivals,
    as well as a 1955 film adaptation starring Marlon Brando, Jean Simmons, Frank
    Sinatra and Vivian Blaine.

    Guys and Dolls was selected as the winner of the 1951 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.
    However, because of writer Abe Burrows' troubles with the House Un-American Activities
    Committee, the Trustees of Columbia University vetoed the selection, and no Pulitzer
    for Drama was awarded that year.

    Hairspray is a musical with music by Marc Shaiman, lyrics by Scott Wittman and
    Shaiman and a book by Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan, based on the 1988 John
    Waters film Hairspray. The songs include 1960s-style dance music and "downtown"
    rhythm and blues. In 1962 Baltimore, Maryland, plump teenager Tracy Turnblad's
    dream is to dance on The Corny Collins Show, a local TV dance program based on
    the real-life Buddy Deane Show. When Tracy wins a role on the show, she becomes
    a celebrity overnight. She then launches a campaign to integrate the show. Hairspray
    is a social commentary on the injustices of parts of American society in the 1960s.

    The musical's original Broadway production opened on August 15, 2002 and won eight
    Tony Awards out of thirteen nominations. It ran for over 2,500 performances and
    closed on January 4, 2009. Hairspray has also had national tours, a London West
    End production, and numerous foreign productions and was adapted as a 2007 musical
    film. The London production was nominated for a record-setting eleven Laurence
    Olivier Awards, winning for Best New Musical and in three other categories.

    The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play
    by Oscar Wilde. First performed on 14 February 1895 at St. James's Theatre in
    London, it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious
    personæ in order to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social
    conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality
    with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire
    of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though
    some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw
    the modern consensus that it was the culmination of Wilde's artistic career so
    far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being
    Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play.

    The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde's career but also heralded
    his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, father of Lord Alfred Douglas, an intimate
    friend of Wilde, planned to present Wilde a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt
    the show. Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission. Soon afterwards,
    however, their feud came to a climax in court, where Wilde's homosexual double
    life was revealed to the Victorian public and he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment.
    Wilde's notoriety caused the play, despite its success, to be closed after just
    86 performances. After his release, he published the play from exile in Paris,
    but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work.

    Rent is a rock musical with music and lyrics by Jonathan Larson based on Giacomo
    Puccini's opera La bohème. It tells the story of a group of impoverished young
    artists and musicians struggling to survive and create in New York's Lower East
    Side in the thriving days of Bohemian Alphabet City, under the shadow of HIV/AIDS.

    The musical was first seen in a limited three-week workshop production at New
    York Theatre Workshop in 1994. This same off-Broadway theatre was also the musical's
    initial home following its official January 25, 1996 opening. The show's creator,
    Jonathan Larson, died suddenly the night before the off-Broadway premiere. The
    show won a Pulitzer Prize, and the production was a hit. The musical moved to
    Broadway's larger Nederlander Theatre on April 29, 1996.

    On Broadway, Rent gained critical acclaim and won a Tony Award for Best Musical
    among other awards. The Broadway production closed on September 7, 2008 after
    a 12-year run of 5,123 performances, the ninth longest-running Broadway show at
    the time. The production grossed over $280 million.

    The success of the show led to several national tours and numerous foreign productions.
    In 2005 it was adapted into a motion picture that features most of the original
    cast members.

    Oedipus the King, also known by the Latin title Oedipus Rex, is an Athenian tragedy
    by Sophocles that was first performed c. 429 BCE. It was the second of Sophocles's
    three Theban plays to be produced, but it comes first in the internal chronology,
    followed by Oedipus at Colonus and then Antigone. Oedipus Rex chronicles the story
    of Oedipus, a man who becomes the king of Thebes who was destined from birth to
    murder his father Laius and marry his mother Jocasta. The play is an example of
    a classic tragedy, noticeably containing an emphasis on how Oedipus's own faults
    contribute to the tragic hero's downfall, as opposed to having fate be the sole
    cause. Over the centuries, Oedipus Rex has come to be regarded by many as the
    Greek tragedy par excellence.

    created by Hans Zimmer with choral arrangements by Lebo M. Directed by Julie Taymor,
    the musical features actors in animal costumes as well as giant, hollow puppets.
    The show is produced by Disney Theatrical.

    The musical debuted July 8, 1997, in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the Orpheum Theatre,
    and was an instant success before premiering on Broadway at the New Amsterdam
    Theater on October 15, 1997 in previews with the official opening on November
    13, 1997. On June 13, 2006, the Broadway production moved to the Minskoff Theatre
    to make way for the musical version of Mary Poppins, where it is still running
    after more than 5,350 performances. It is now Broadway's fifth longest-running
    show in history. As of April 2012, it is the highest grossing Broadway show of
    all time, having grossed $853.8 million.

    The show debuted in the West End's Lyceum Theatre on October 19, 1999 and is still
    running. The cast of the West End production were invited to perform at the Royal
    Variety Performance 2008 at the London Palladium on December 11, in the presence
    of senior members of the British Royal Family.

    Richard III is a history play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written
    in approximately 1592. It depicts the Machiavellian rise to power and subsequent
    short reign of Richard III of England. The play is grouped among the histories
    in the First Folio and is most often classified as such. Occasionally, however,
    as in the quarto edition, it is termed a tragedy. Richard III concludes Shakespeare's
    first tetralogy.

    It is the second longest play in the canon after Hamlet, and is the longest of
    the First Folio, whose version of Hamlet is shorter than its Quarto counterpart.
    The play is rarely performed unabridged; often, certain peripheral characters
    are removed entirely. In such instances extra lines are often invented or added
    from elsewhere in the sequence to establish the nature of characters' relationships.
    A further reason for abridgment is that Shakespeare assumed that his audiences
    would be familiar with the Henry VI plays, and frequently made indirect references
    to events in them, such as Richard's murder of Henry VI or the defeat of Henry's
    queen Margaret.

    Chicago is a musical with music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb and a book
    by Ebb and Bob Fosse. Set in Prohibition-era Chicago, the musical is based on
    a 1926 play of the same name by reporter Maurine Dallas Watkins about actual criminals
    and crimes she reported on. The story is a satire on corruption in the administration
    of criminal justice and the concept of the "celebrity criminal."

    The original Broadway production opened in 1975 at the 46th Street Theatre and
    ran for 936 performances until 1977. Bob Fosse also choreographed the original
    production, and his style is strongly identified with the show. Following a West
    End debut in 1979 which ran for 600 performances, Chicago was revived on Broadway
    in 1996, and a year later in the West End.

    The Broadway revival holds the record for the longest-running musical revival
    and the longest-running American musical in Broadway history, and is the third
    longest-running show in Broadway history having played more than 6,700 performances.
    The West End revival ran for nearly 15 years, becoming the longest-running American
    musical in West End history, and it has enjoyed several tours and international
    productions. The Academy Award-winning 2002 film version of the musical was directed
    by Rob Marshall and starred Renée Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere,
    John C. Reilly, and Queen Latifah.

    As You Like It is a pastoral comedy by William Shakespeare believed to have been
    written in 1599 or early 1600 and first published in the First Folio, 1623. The
    play's first performance is uncertain, though a performance at Wilton House in
    1603 has been suggested as a possibility. As You Like It follows its heroine Rosalind
    as she flees persecution in her uncle's court, accompanied by her cousin Celia
    and Touchstone the court jester, to find safety and eventually, love, in the Forest
    of Arden. Historically, critical response has varied, with some critics finding
    the work of lesser quality than other Shakespearean works and some finding the
    play a work of great merit.

    The play features one of Shakespeare's most famous and oft-quoted speeches, "All
    the world's a stage", and is the origin of the phrase "too much of a good thing".
    The play remains a favourite among audiences and has been adapted for radio, film,
    and musical theatre.

    Evita is a musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. It
    concentrates on the life of Argentine political leader Eva Perón, the second wife
    of Argentine president Juan Perón. The story follows Evita's early life, rise
    to power, charity work, and eventual death.

    The musical began as a rock opera concept album released in 1976. Its success
    led to productions in London's West End in 1978, winning the Laurence Olivier
    Award for Best Musical, and on Broadway a year later, where it was the first British
    musical to receive the Tony Award for Best Musical.

    This has been followed by a string of professional tours and worldwide productions
    and numerous cast albums, as well as a major 1996 film of the musical starring

    A Chorus Line is a musical with music by Marvin Hamlisch, lyrics by Edward Kleban
    and a book by James Kirkwood, Jr. and Nicholas Dante. Centred on seventeen Broadway
    dancers auditioning for spots on a chorus line, the musical is set on the bare
    stage of a Broadway theatre during an audition for a musical. A Chorus Line provides
    a glimpse into the personalities of the performers and the choreographer as they
    describe the events that have shaped their lives and their decisions to become
    dancers.

    Following several workshops and an Off-Broadway production, A Chorus Line opened
    on Broadway on July 25, 1975, directed and choreographed by Buffalo native Michael
    Bennett. An unprecedented box office and critical hit, the musical received 12
    Tony Award nominations and won 9 of them, in addition to the 1976 Pulitzer Prize
    for Drama.

    The original Broadway production ran for 6,137 performances, becoming the longest-running
    production in Broadway history until surpassed by Cats in 1997, and the longest-running
    Broadway musical originally produced in the US, until surpassed in 2011 by Chicago.
    It remains the sixth longest-running Broadway show ever. Its success has spawned
    many successful productions worldwide. It began a lengthy run in the West End
    in 1976 and was revived on Broadway in 2006. The current West End revival opened
    in 2013.

    We Will Rock You is a musical based on the songs of Queen with a book by Ben Elton.
    The musical tells the story of a group of Bohemians who struggle to restore the
    free exchange of thought, fashion, and live music in a distant future where everyone
    dresses, thinks and does the same. Musical instruments and composers are forbidden,
    and rock music is all but unknown.

    Directed by Christopher Renshaw and choreographed by Arlene Phillips, the original
    West End production opened at the Dominion Theatre on 14 May 2002, with Tony Vincent,
    Hannah Jane Fox, Sharon D. Clarke and Kerry Ellis in principal roles. Although
    the musical was at first panned by critics, it has become an audience favourite,
    becoming the longest-running musical at the Dominion Theatre, celebrating its
    tenth anniversary on 14 May 2012.

    A number of international productions have since followed the original, and We
    Will Rock You has been seen in five of the world's continents. Many productions
    are still active globally.

    Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a 1979 musical thriller with
    music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and libretto by Hugh Wheeler. The musical
    is based on the 1973 play Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street by Christopher
    Bond. Set in 19th century England, the musical tells the story of Benjamin Barker,
    aka Sweeney Todd, who returns to London after 15 years' transportation on trumped-up
    charges. When he finds out that his wife poisoned herself after being raped by
    the judge who transported him, he vows revenge on the judge and, later, the whole
    world. He teams up with a piemaker, Mrs. Lovett, and opens a barbershop in which
    he slits the throats of customers and has them baked into pies.

    Sweeney Todd opened on Broadway in 1979 and in the West End in 1980. In addition
    to several revivals the musical has been presented by opera companies. It won
    the Tony Award for Best Musical and Olivier Award for Best New Musical.

    Into the Woods is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book
    by James Lapine. It debuted in San Diego at the Old Globe Theatre in 1986, and
    premiered on Broadway in 1987. Bernadette Peters' performance as the Witch and
    Joanna Gleason's portrayal of the Baker's Wife brought acclaim to the production
    during its original Broadway run. Into the Woods won several Tony Awards, including
    Best Score, Best Book, and Best Actress in a Musical, in a year dominated by The
    Phantom of the Opera.

    The musical has been produced many times, with a 1988 US national tour, a 1990
    West End production, a 1991 television production, a 1997 tenth anniversary concert,
    a 2002 Broadway revival, a 2010 London revival and in 2012 as part of New York
    City's outdoor Shakespeare in the Park series. The musical intertwines the plots
    of several Brothers Grimm fairy tales and follows them to explore the consequences
    of the characters' wishes and quests. The main characters are taken from "Little
    Red Riding Hood", "Jack and the Beanstalk", "Rapunzel", and "Cinderella", as well
    as several others. The musical is tied together by an original story involving
    a baker and his wife and their quest to begin a family, and their interaction
    with a Witch and her curse on them.

    Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat is an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical
    with lyrics by Tim Rice. The story is based on the "coat of many colors" story
    of Joseph from the Bible's Book of Genesis. This was the first Lloyd Webber and
    Rice musical to be performed publicly.

    Joseph was first presented as a 15-minute pop cantata at Colet Court School in
    London in 1968 and was recorded as a concept album in 1969. After the success
    of the next Lloyd Webber and Rice piece, Jesus Christ Superstar, Joseph received
    stage productions beginning in 1970 and expanded recordings in 1971 and 1972.
    While still undergoing various transformations and expansions, the musical was
    produced in the West End in 1973, and in its full format was recorded in 1974
    and opened on Broadway in 1982. Several major revivals and a 1999 straight-to-video
    film, starring Donny Osmond, followed.

    The show has little spoken dialogue; it is completely sung-through. Its family-friendly
    storyline, universal themes and catchy music have resulted in numerous productions
    of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat; according to the Really Useful
    Group, by 2008 more than 20,000 schools and amateur theatre groups had successfully
    put on productions.

    South Pacific is a musical composed by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein
    II and book by Hammerstein and Joshua Logan. The work premiered in 1949 on Broadway
    and was an immediate success, running for 1,925 performances. The story is based
    on James A. Michener's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1947 book Tales of the South Pacific,
    combining elements of several of the stories in that book. Rodgers and Hammerstein
    believed that they could write a work based on Michener's stories that would be
    financially successful and, at the same time, send a strong progressive message
    on racism.

    The plot centers on an American nurse stationed at a U.S. Naval base on a South
    Pacific island during World War II who falls in love with an expatriate French
    plantation owner but struggles to accept his mixed-race children. A secondary
    romance, between a U.S. lieutenant and a young Tonkinese woman, explores his fears
    of the social consequences should he marry his Asian sweetheart. The issue of
    racial prejudice is candidly explored throughout the musical, most controversially
    in the lieutenant's song, "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". Supporting characters,
    including a comic petty officer and the Tonkinese girl's mother, help to tie the
    stories together. Due to his lack of knowledge of the military, Hammerstein had
    difficulty in writing that part of the text; the director of the original production,
    Logan, assisted him and received credit as co-writer of the book, but Logan always
    felt that he was underpaid for his contribution.

    Ethel Barrymore Theatre. The Broadway production was directed by Elia Kazan and

    The King and I is a musical, the fifth by the team of composer Richard Rodgers
    and dramatist Oscar Hammerstein II. It is based on the 1944 novel Anna and the
    King of Siam by Margaret Landon, which derives from the memoirs of Anna Leonowens,
    governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s. The musical's
    plot relates the experiences of Anna, a British schoolteacher hired as part of
    the King's drive to modernize his country. The relationship between the King and
    Anna is marked by conflict through much of the piece, as well as by a love that
    neither can admit. The musical premiered on March 29, 1951, at Broadway's St.
    James Theatre. It ran nearly three years, then the fourth longest-running Broadway
    musical in history, and has had many tours and revivals.

    In 1950, theatrical attorney Fanny Holtzmann was looking for a part for her client,
    veteran leading lady Gertrude Lawrence. Holtzmann realized that Landon's book
    would be an ideal vehicle and contacted Rodgers and Hammerstein, who were initially
    reluctant but agreed to write the musical. The pair initially sought Rex Harrison
    to play the supporting part of the King, a role that he had played in the 1946
    movie made from Landon's book, but he was unavailable. They settled on actor and
    television director Yul Brynner.

    Gypsy is a musical with music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and a
    book by Arthur Laurents. Gypsy is loosely based on the 1957 memoirs of Gypsy Rose
    Lee, the famous striptease artist, and focuses on her mother, Rose, whose name
    has become synonymous with "the ultimate show business mother." It follows the
    dreams and efforts of Rose to raise two daughters to perform onstage and casts
    an affectionate eye on the hardships of show business life. The character of Louise
    is based on Lee, and the character of June is based on Lee's sister, the actress
    June Havoc.

    The musical contains many songs that became popular standards, including "Everything's
    Coming up Roses", "Together", "Small World", "Some People", "Let Me Entertain
    You", "All I Need Is the Girl", and "Rose's Turn". It is frequently considered
    one of the crowning achievements of the mid-20th century's conventional musical
    theatre art form, often called the "book musical".

    Gypsy has been referred to as the greatest American musical by numerous critics
    and writers, among them Ben Brantley and Frank Rich. Rich wrote that " Gypsy is
    nothing if not Broadway's own brassy, unlikely answer to 'King Lear.'" Theater
    critic Clive Barnes wrote that " 'Gypsy' is one of the best of musicals..." and
    described the character of Rose as "one of the few truly complex characters in
    the American musical...."

    Avenue Q is an American musical in two acts, conceived by Robert Lopez and Jeff
    Marx, who wrote the music and lyrics. The book was written by Jeff Whitty and
    the show was directed by Jason Moore. Avenue Q is an "autobiographical and biographical"
    coming-of-age parable, addressing and satirizing the issues and anxieties associated
    with entering adulthood. Its characters lament that as children, they were assured
    by their parents, and by children's television programs such as PBS's Sesame Street,
    that they were "special" and "could do anything"; but as adults, they have discovered
    to their surprise and dismay that in the real world their options are limited,
    and they are no more "special" than anyone else. The musical is notable for the
    use of puppets alongside human actors.

    Originally conceived as a television series, the show was developed as a stage
    production at the 2002 National Music Theatre Conference at the Eugene O'Neill
    Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut. It opened Off-Broadway in March 2003,
    co-produced by The New Group and the Vineyard Theatre, and transferred to Broadway
    in July 2003 where it won three Tony Awards, including Best Musical, and spawned
    Las Vegas and West End productions, two national tours, and a variety of international
    productions.

    Monty Python's Spamalot is a musical comedy "lovingly ripped off from" the 1975
    film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Like the film, it is a highly irreverent
    parody of the Arthurian Legend, but it differs from the film in many ways.

    Idle explained the title in a February 2004 press release:

    I like the title Spamalot a lot. We tested it with audiences on my recent US tour
    and they liked it as much as I did, which is gratifying. After all, they are the
    ones who will be paying Broadway prices to see the show. It comes from a line
    in the movie which goes: "we eat ham, and jam and Spam a lot."

    The original 2005 Broadway production, directed by Mike Nichols, won three Tony
    Awards, including the Tony Award for Best Musical of the 2004–2005 season and
    received 14 Tony Award nominations. During its initial run of over 1,500 performances
    it was seen by more than two million people and grossed over $175 million.

    Cabaret is a musical based on a book written by Christopher Isherwood, music by
    John Kander and lyrics by Fred Ebb. The 1966 Broadway production became a hit
    and spawned a 1972 film as well as numerous subsequent productions.

    It is based on John Van Druten's 1951 play I Am a Camera, which in turn was adapted
    from the 1939 short novel Goodbye to Berlin by Christopher Isherwood. Set in 1931
    Berlin as the Nazis are rising to power, it focuses on nightlife at the seedy
    Kit Kat Klub and revolves around the 19-year-old English cabaret performer Sally
    Bowles and her relationship with the young American writer Cliff Bradshaw.

    A sub-plot involves the doomed romance between German boarding house owner Fräulein
    Schneider and her elderly suitor Herr Schultz, a Jewish fruit vendor. Overseeing
    the action is the Master of Ceremonies at the Kit Kat Klub which serves as a constant
    metaphor for the tenuous and threatening state of late Weimar Germany throughout
    the show.

    Chess is a musical with music by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, formerly of
    ABBA, and with lyrics by Tim Rice. The story involves a romantic triangle between
    two top chess players, an American and a Russian, in a world chess championship,
    and a woman who manages one and falls in love with the other; all in the context
    of a Cold War struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union, during
    which both countries wanted to win international chess tournaments for propaganda
    purposes. Although the protagonists were not intended to represent any specific
    individuals, the character of the American was loosely based on chess grandmaster
    Bobby Fischer, while elements of the story may have been inspired by the chess
    careers of Russian grandmasters Viktor Korchnoi and Anatoly Karpov.

    As had been done with Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ
    Superstar, and Evita, a highly successful concept album of Chess was released
    in 1984. The first theatrical production of Chess opened in London's West End
    in 1986 and played for three years. A much-altered U.S. version premièred on Broadway
    in 1988, but survived only for two months. Chess is frequently revised for new
    productions, many of which try to merge elements from both the London and Broadway
    versions; however, no major revival production of the musical has yet been attempted
    either on West End or Broadway.

    Anything Goes is a musical with music and lyrics by Cole Porter. The original
    book was a collaborative effort by Guy Bolton and P.G. Wodehouse, heavily revised
    by the team of Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse. The story concerns madcap antics
    aboard an ocean liner bound from New York to London. Billy Crocker is a stowaway
    in love with heiress Hope Harcourt, who is engaged to Lord Evelyn Oakleigh. Nightclub
    singer Reno Sweeney and Public Enemy #13 Moonface Martin aid Billy in his quest
    to win Hope. The musical introduced such songs as "Anything Goes", "You're the
    Top", and "I Get a Kick Out of You."

    Since its 1934 debut at the Neil Simon Theatre on Broadway, the musical has been
    revived several times in the United States and Britain and has been filmed twice.
    The musical has long been a popular choice for school and community productions.

    Spring Awakening is a rock musical with music by Duncan Sheik and a book and lyrics
    by Steven Sater. It is based on the controversial German play Spring Awakening
    by Frank Wedekind which was banned in Germany for some time due to its frank portrayal
    of abortion, homosexuality, rape, child abuse and suicide. Set in late-19th century
    Germany, the musical tells the story of teenagers discovering the inner and outer
    tumult of sexuality. In the musical, alternative rock is employed as part of the
    folk-infused rock score.

    Following its conception in the late 1990s and various workshops, concerts, rewrites
    and its Off-Broadway debut, the original Broadway production of Spring Awakening
    opened at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre on December 10, 2006. Its cast included Jonathan
    Groff, Lea Michele and John Gallagher, Jr. whilst its creative team embodied director
    Michael Mayer and choreographer Bill T. Jones. The original Broadway production
    won 8 Tony Awards, including Tonys for Best Musical, Direction, Book, Score and
    Featured Actor. The production also garnered 4 Drama Desk Awards whilst its original
    cast album received a Grammy Award.

    The success of the Broadway production has spawned several other productions worldwide,
    including various US productions, a short West End production that won 4 Laurence
    Olivier Awards including Best Musical, and a series of international productions.

    Miss Saigon is a musical by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil, with lyrics
    by Boublil and Richard Maltby, Jr. It is based on Giacomo Puccini's opera Madame
    Butterfly, and similarly tells the tragic tale of a doomed romance involving an
    Asian woman abandoned by her American lover. The setting of the plot is relocated
    to the 1970s Saigon during the Vietnam War, and Madame Butterfly's story of marriage
    between an American lieutenant and Japanese girl is replaced by a romance between
    an American GI and a Vietnamese bar girl.

    The musical premièred at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in London on 20 September
    1989, closing after over four thousand performances, on 30 October 1999. It opened
    on Broadway at the Broadway Theatre in 1991 and subsequently played in many other
    cities and embarked on tours.

    The musical represented Schönberg and Boublil's second major success, following
    Les Misérables in 1985. As of January 2013, Miss Saigon is still the eleventh
    longest-running Broadway musical in musical theatre history.

    The Tragedy of Julius Caesar is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to
    have been written in 1599. It portrays the 44 BC conspiracy against the Roman
    dictator Julius Caesar, his assassination and the defeat of the conspirators at
    the Battle of Philippi. It is one of several plays written by Shakespeare based
    on true events from Roman history, which also include Coriolanus and Antony and
    Cleopatra.

    Although the title is Julius Caesar, Julius Caesar is not the most visible character
    in its action; he appears in only three scenes, and is killed at the beginning
    of the third act. Marcus Brutus speaks more than four times as many lines, and
    the central psychological drama is his struggle between the conflicting demands
    of honor, patriotism, and friendship.

    Titus Andronicus is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, and possibly George Peele,
    believed to have been written between 1588 and 1593. It is thought to be Shakespeare's
    first tragedy, and is often seen as his attempt to emulate the violent and bloody
    revenge plays of his contemporaries, which were extremely popular with audiences
    throughout the sixteenth century.

    The play is set during the latter days of the Roman Empire and tells the fictional
    story of Titus, a general in the Roman army, who is engaged in a cycle of revenge
    with Tamora, Queen of the Goths. It is Shakespeare's bloodiest and most violent
    work and traditionally was one of his least respected plays. Although it was extremely
    popular in its day, it fell out of favour during the Victorian era, primarily
    because of what was considered to be a distasteful use of graphic violence, but
    from around the middle of the twentieth century its reputation began to improve.

    Jersey Boys is a jukebox musical with music by Bob Gaudio, lyrics by Bob Crewe,
    and book by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice. It is presented in a documentary-style
    format that dramatizes the formation, success and eventual break-up of the 1960s
    rock 'n roll group The Four Seasons. The musical is structured as four "seasons",
    each narrated by a different member of the band who gives his own perspective
    on its history and music. Songs include "Big Girls Don't Cry", "Sherry", "December
    1963", "My Eyes Adored You", "Stay", "Can't Take My Eyes Off You", "Working My
    Way Back to You" and "Rag Doll", among others. The title refers to the fact that
    the members of The Four Seasons are from New Jersey.

    The musical opened on Broadway in 2005 and has since had a North American National
    Tour and productions in London's West End, Las Vegas, Chicago, Toronto, Melbourne
    and other Australian cities, Singapore and elsewhere. Jersey Boys won four 2006
    Tony Awards including Best Musical, and the 2009 Laurence Olivier Award for Best
    New Musical.

    Pygmalion is a 1912 play by George Bernard Shaw, named after a Greek mythological
    character.

    Professor of phonetics Henry Higgins makes a bet that he can train a bedraggled
    Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, to pass for a duchess at an ambassador's
    garden party by teaching her to assume a veneer of gentility, the most important
    element of which, he believes, is impeccable speech. The play is a sharp lampoon
    of the rigid British class system of the day and a commentary on women's independence.

    In ancient Greek mythology, Pygmalion fell in love with one of his sculptures
    that came to life and was a popular subject for Victorian era English playwrights,
    including one of Shaw's influences, W. S. Gilbert, who wrote a successful play
    based on the story in 1871, called Pygmalion and Galatea. Shaw also would have
    been familiar with the burlesque version, Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed. Shaw's
    play has been adapted numerous times, most notably as the musical My Fair Lady
    and the film of that name.

    Peer Gynt is a five-act play in verse by the Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen,
    loosely based on the fairy tale Per Gynt. Written in the Dano-Norwegian language,
    it is the most widely performed Norwegian play. According to Klaus Van Den Berg,
    the "cinematic script blends poetry with social satire and realistic scenes with
    surreal ones". Peer Gynt has also been described as the story of a life based
    on procrastination and avoidance. A first edition of 1,250 copies was published
    on 14 November 1867 in Copenhagen. Although the first edition swiftly sold out,
    a re-print of 2,000 copies, which followed after only 14 days, didn't sell out
    until seven years later.

    While Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson admired the play's "satire in Norwegian egotism, narrowness,
    and self-sufficiency" and described it as "magnificent", Hans Christian Andersen,
    Georg Brandes and Clemens Petersen all joined a widespread hostility. Enraged
    by Petersen's criticisms in particular, Ibsen defended his work by arguing that
    it "is poetry; and if it isn't, it will become such. The conception of poetry
    in our country, in Norway, shall shape itself according to this book." Despite
    this defense of his poetic achievement in Peer Gynt, the play was his last to
    employ verse; from The League of Youth onwards, Ibsen was to write drama only
    in prose.

    Oklahoma! is the first musical written by the team of composer Richard Rodgers
    and librettist Oscar Hammerstein II. The musical is based on Lynn Riggs' 1931
    play, Green Grow the Lilacs. Set in Oklahoma Territory outside the town of Claremore
    in 1906, it tells the story of cowboy Curly McLain and his romance with farm girl
    Laurey Williams. A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious
    fiancée, Ado Annie.

    The original Broadway production opened on March 31, 1943. It was a box-office
    smash and ran for an unprecedented 2,212 performances, later enjoying award-winning
    revivals, national tours, foreign productions and an Academy Award-winning 1955
    film adaptation. It has long been a popular choice for school and community productions.

    This musical, building on the innovations of the earlier Show Boat, epitomized
    the development of the "book musical", a musical play where the songs and dances
    are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that are
    able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter. In addition, Oklahoma! features
    musical themes, or motifs, that recur throughout the work to connect the music
    and story. A fifteen-minute "dream ballet" reflects Laurey's struggle with her
    feelings about two men, Curley and Jud. A special Pulitzer Prize was awarded to
    Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II for Oklahoma! in the category of "Special
    Awards And Citations – Letters" in 1944.

    A Doll's House is a three-act play in prose by Henrik Ibsen. It premiered at the
    Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 21 December 1879, having been published
    earlier that month.

    The play is significant for its critical attitude toward 19th century marriage
    norms. It aroused great controversy at the time, as it concludes with the protagonist,
    Nora, leaving her husband and children because she wants to discover herself.
    Ibsen was inspired by the belief that "a woman cannot be herself in modern society,"
    since it is "an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors
    and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint." Its ideas
    can also be seen as having a wider application: Michael Meyer argues that the
    play's theme is not women's rights, but rather "the need of every individual to
    find out the kind of person he or she really is and to strive to become that person."
    In a speech given to the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights in 1898, Ibsen
    insisted that he "must disclaim the honor of having consciously worked for the
    women's rights movement," since he wrote "without any conscious thought of making
    propaganda," his task having been "the description of humanity."

    of the longest running musicals in West End history with 7,406 performances, but
    the Broadway production only ran for 761 performances. It is the most popular

    Little Shop of Horrors is a comedy horror rock musical, by composer Alan Menken
    and writer Howard Ashman, about a hapless florist shop worker who raises a plant
    that feeds on human blood and flesh. The musical is based on the low-budget 1960
    black comedy film The Little Shop of Horrors, directed by Roger Corman. The music,
    composed by Menken in the style of early 1960s rock and roll, doo-wop and early
    Motown, includes several well-known tunes, including the title song, "Skid Row",
    "Somewhere That's Green", and "Suddenly, Seymour".

    In addition to the original long-running 1982 off-Broadway production and subsequent
    Broadway production, the musical has been performed all over the world. Because
    of its small cast and relatively simple orchestrations, it has become popular
    with community theatre, school and other amateur groups. The musical was also
    made into a 1986 film of the same name, directed by Frank Oz.

    The Cherry Orchard is Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's last play. It premiered
    at the Moscow Art Theatre 17 January 1904 in a production directed by Constantin
    Stanislavski. Chekhov intended this play as a comedy and it does contain some
    elements of farce; however, Stanislavski insisted on directing the play as a tragedy.
    Since this initial production, directors have had to contend with the dual nature
    of this play.

    The play concerns an aristocratic Russian woman and her family as they return
    to the family's estate just before it is auctioned to pay the mortgage. While
    presented with options to save the estate, the family essentially does nothing
    and the play ends with the estate being sold to the son of a former serf, and
    the family leaving to the sound of the cherry orchard being cut down. The story
    presents themes of cultural futility — both the futility of the aristocracy to
    maintain its status and the futility of the bourgeoisie to find meaning in its
    newfound materialism. In reflecting the socio-economic forces at work in Russia
    at the turn of the 20th century, including the rise of the middle class after
    the abolition of serfdom in the mid-19th century and the sinking of the aristocracy,
    the play reflects forces at work around the globe in that period.

    Legally Blonde is a musical with music and lyrics by Laurence O'Keefe and Nell
    Benjamin and book by Heather Hach. The story is based on the novel Legally Blonde
    by Amanda Brown and the 2001 film of the same name. It tells the story of Elle
    Woods, a sorority girl who enrolls at Harvard Law School to win back her ex-boyfriend
    Warner. She discovers how her knowledge of the law can help others, and successfully
    defends exercise queen Brooke Wyndham in a murder trial.

    Legally Blonde premiered in pre-Broadway tryouts in San Francisco, California.
    In April 2007 the show moved to Broadway, opening to mostly positive reviews and
    grossed more than $1,000,000 a week on several occasions. Jerry Mitchell directed
    and choreographed. The original cast included Laura Bell Bundy as Elle Woods,
    Christian Borle as Emmett Forrest and Richard H. Blake as Warner. It received
    seven Tony nominations and ten Drama Desk nominations but failed to win any. The
    West End production opened in January 2010 at the Savoy Theatre. The West End
    production was nominated for five Laurence Olivier Awards and won three, including
    the Best New Musical award.

    The musical was recorded in September 2007 and aired on MTV in October 2007. Following
    this, a reality TV program was aired showing the audition process for the next
    person to play Elle Woods on Broadway. The winner was Bailey Hanks, who played
    the role from July 23, 2008 until the production closed on October 19, 2008.

    Cyrano de Bergerac is a play written in 1897 by Edmond Rostand. Although there
    was a real Cyrano de Bergerac, the play is a fictionalization of his life that
    follows the broad outlines of it.

    The entire play is written in verse, in rhyming couplets of 12 syllables per line,
    very close to the Alexandrine format, but the verses sometimes lack a caesura.
    It is also meticulously researched, down to the names of the members of the Académie
    française and the dames précieuses glimpsed before the performance in the first
    scene.

    The play has been translated and performed many times, and is responsible for
    introducing the word "panache" into the English language. Cyrano is in fact famed
    for his panache, and the play ends with him saying "My panache." just before his
    death. The two most famous English translations are those by Brian Hooker and
    Anthony Burgess.

    The Crucible is a 1953 play by the American playwright Arthur Miller. It was initially
    called "The Chronicles of Sarah Good". It is a dramatization of the Salem witch
    trials that took place in the Province of Massachusetts Bay during 1692 and 1693.
    Miller wrote the play as an allegory of McCarthyism, when the U.S. government
    blacklisted accused communists. Miller himself was questioned by the House of
    Representatives' Committee on Un-American Activities in 1956 and convicted of
    "contempt of Congress" for refusing to identify others present at meetings he
    had attended. It was first performed at the Martin Beck Theater on Broadway on
    January 22, 1953. Miller felt that this production was too stylized and cold and
    the reviews for it were largely hostile. Nonetheless, the production won the 1953
    "Best Play" Tony Award. A year later a new production succeeded and the play became
    a classic. It is a central work in the canon of American drama.

    The Rocky Horror Show is a musical with music, lyrics and a book by Richard O'Brien.
    A humorous tribute to the science fiction and horror B movies of the late 1940s
    through early 1970s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting
    caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad transvestite scientist unveiling
    his new creation, a muscle man named Rocky Horror.

    Produced and directed by Jim Sharman, the original London production of the musical
    premiered at the Royal Court Theatre on 19 June 1973 before moving to several
    other locations and closing on 13 September 1980, running for a total of 2,960
    performances and winning the 1973 Evening Standard Award for Best Musical. Its
    1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful 9 month run but its 1975
    Broadway debut lasted only 3 previews and 45 showings despite gaining 1 Tony nomination
    and 3 Drama Desk nominations. Various international productions have since spanned
    across 6 of the world's continents as well as West End and Broadway revivals and
    8 UK tours.

    The musical has since developed a cult following and was also adapted into the
    1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which today has a worldwide cult following
    and has the longest-running release in film history. The musical was ranked 8th
    in a BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the "Nation's Number One Essential Musicals".

    Notre-Dame de Paris is a sung-through French-Canadian musical which debuted on
    16 September 1998 in Paris. It is based upon the novel Notre-Dame de Paris by
    the French novelist Victor Hugo. The music was composed by Riccardo Cocciante
    and the lyrics are by Luc Plamondon.

    Since its debut, it has been played in Canada, France, Belgium, Russia, Switzerland,
    Italy, Spain, Japan, China, South Korea, Haiti and Taiwan. A shorter version in
    English was performed in 2000 in Las Vegas, Nevada and a full-length London production,
    also in English, ran for seventeen months. Popular songs from the show, such as
    Belle and Le temps des cathédrales have also been translated into Belarusian,
    Catalan, Czech, German, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Dutch and English.

    Notre-Dame de Paris, according to the Guinness Book of Records, had the most successful
    first year of any musical ever. The score has been recorded at least seven times
    to date: the original French concept album, which featured Israeli singer Achinoam
    Nini as Esmeralda was followed by a live, complete recording of the original Paris
    cast. A complete recording of the score in Italian was made, along with a single
    disc of highlights in Spanish from the Barcelona production. The original London
    cast album featured several of the original Paris stars, but only preserved a
    fraction of the score in English. The orchestral group I Fiamminghi recorded a
    CD of melodies from the score. A complete set of instrumental backing tracks has
    also been released.

    Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a play by Tennessee Williams. One of Williams's best-known
    works and his personal favorite, the play won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in
    1955. Set in the "plantation home in the Mississippi Delta" of Big Daddy Pollitt,
    a wealthy cotton tycoon, the play examines the relationships among members of
    Big Daddy's family, primarily between his son Brick and Maggie the "Cat", Brick's
    wife.

    Cat on a Hot Tin Roof features several recurring motifs, such as social mores,
    greed, superficiality, mendacity, decay, sexual desire, repression, and death.
    Dialogue throughout is often rendered phonetically to represent accents of the
    Southern United States.

    The play was adapted as a motion picture of the same name in 1958, starring Elizabeth
    Taylor and Paul Newman as Maggie and Brick, respectively. Williams made substantial
    excisions and alterations to the play for a revival in 1974. This has been the
    version used for most subsequent revivals, which have been numerous.

    Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust is a tragic play in two parts: Faust. Der Tragödie
    erster Teil and Faust. Der Tragödie zweiter Teil. Although rarely staged in its
    entirety, it is the play with the largest audience numbers on German-language
    stages. Faust is Goethe's most famous work and considered by many to be one of
    the greatest works of German literature.

    Goethe completed a preliminary version of Part One in 1806. The 1808 publication
    was followed by the revised 1828–29 edition, which was the last to be edited by
    Goethe himself. Prior to these appeared a partial printing in 1790 of Faust, a
    Fragment.

    The earliest forms of the work, known as the Urfaust, were developed between 1772
    and 1775; however, the details of that development are no longer entirely clear.
    Urfaust has twenty-two scenes, one in prose, two largely prose and the remaining
    1,441 lines in rhymed verse. The manuscript is lost, but a copy was discovered
    in 1886.

    Goethe finished writing Faust Part Two in 1831. In contrast to Faust Part One,
    the focus here is no longer on the soul of Faust, which has been sold to the devil,
    but rather on social phenomena such as psychology, history and politics, in addition
    to mystical and philosophical topics. The second part formed the principal occupation
    of Goethe's last years. It appeared only posthumously in 1832.

    The Glass Menagerie is a four-character memory play by Tennessee Williams. Williams
    worked on various drafts of the play prior to writing a version of it as a screenplay
    for MGM, to whom Williams was contracted. Initial ideas stemmed from one of his
    short stories, and the screenplay originally went under the name of 'The Gentleman
    Caller'.

    The play premiered in Chicago in 1944. It was championed by Chicago critics Ashton
    Stevens and Claudia Cassidy whose enthusiasm helped build audiences so the producers
    could move the play to Broadway where it won the New York Drama Critics Circle
    Award in 1945. Laurette Taylor originated the role of the all-too-loving mother,
    Amanda Wingfield. In the 2004 documentary Broadway: The Golden Age, by the Legends
    Who Were There, Broadway veterans nearly unanimously rank Taylor's performance
    as the most memorable of their entire lives. The Glass Menagerie was Williams's
    first successful play; he went on to become one of America's most highly regarded
    playwrights.

    The play was reworked from one of Williams's short stories "Portrait of a Girl
    in Glass". The story is also written from the point of view of narrator Tom Wingfield,
    and many of his soliloquies from The Glass Menagerie seem lifted straight from
    this original. Certain elements have clearly been omitted from the play, including
    the reasoning for Laura's fascination with Jim's freckles. Generally the story
    contains the same plot as the play, with certain sections given more emphasis,
    and character details edited.

    Godspell is a musical by Stephen Schwartz and a book by John-Michael Tebelak.
    It opened off Broadway on May 17, 1971, and has played in various touring companies
    and revivals many times since, including a 2011 revival which played on Broadway
    from October 13, 2011 to June 24, 2012. Several cast albums have been released
    over the years and one of its songs, "Day by Day" from the original cast album,
    reached #13 on the Billboard pop singles chart in the summer of 1972.

    The structure of the musical is that of a series of parables, based on the Gospel
    of Matthew. These are then interspersed with a variety of modern music set primarily
    to lyrics from traditional hymns, with the passion of Christ treated briefly near
    the end of the performance. It started as a college project performed by students
    at Carnegie Mellon University and moved to La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in
    Greenwich Village. It was then re-scored for an off-Broadway production which
    became a long-running success. A junior one-act version with some songs removed
    has also been made under the title Godspell Junior.

    Rock of Ages is a rock/jukebox musical, with a book by Chris D'Arienzo, built
    around classic rock hits from the 1980s, especially from the famous glam metal
    bands of the decade. The musical features songs from Styx, Journey, Bon Jovi,
    Pat Benatar, Twisted Sister, Steve Perry, Poison and Europe among other well-known
    rock bands.

    It is directed by Kristin Hanggi and choreographed by Kelly Devine with music
    supervision, arrangements, and orchestrations by Ethan Popp. Arrangements for
    the original Los Angeles production were furnished by David Gibbs.

    The show is noted for being more lighthearted and comedic than other shows on
    Broadway. During performance, the performers frequently break the "fourth wall",
    directly addressing the audience and seemingly forgetting that they are actors
    in a musical.

    Show Boat is a 1927 musical in two acts, with music by Jerome Kern and book and
    lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. Based on Edna Ferber's bestselling novel of the
    same name, the musical follows the lives of the performers, stagehands, and dock
    workers on the Cotton Blossom, a Mississippi River show boat, over forty years,
    from 1887 to 1927. Its themes include racial prejudice and tragic, enduring love.
    The musical contributed such classic songs as "Ol' Man River", "Make Believe",
    and "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man".

    The arrival of Show Boat on Broadway was a watershed moment in the history of
    American musicals. Compared to the trivial and unrealistic operettas, light musical
    comedies, and "Follies"-type musical revues that defined Broadway in the 1890s
    and early 20th century, Show Boat "was a radical departure in musical storytelling,
    marrying spectacle with seriousness". According to The Complete Book of Light
    Opera:

    "Here we come to a completely new genre – the musical play as distinguished from
    musical comedy. Now... the play was the thing, and everything else was subservient
    to that play. Now... came complete integration of song, humor and production numbers
    into a single and inextricable artistic entity."

    Hedda Gabler is a play first published in 1890 by Norwegian playwright Henrik
    Ibsen. The play premiered in 1891 in Germany to negative reviews, but has subsequently
    gained recognition as a classic of realism, nineteenth century theatre, and world
    drama. A 1902 production was a major sensation on Broadway starring Minnie Maddern
    Fiske and following its initial limited run was revived with the actress the following
    year.

    The character of Hedda is considered by some critics as one of the great dramatic
    roles in theatre and some portrayals have been very controversial, especially
    in the New Zealand play "2B or not 2B" where a male plays Hedda. Depending on
    the interpretation, Hedda may be portrayed as an idealistic heroine fighting society,
    a victim of circumstance, a prototypical feminist, or a manipulative villain.

    Hedda's married name is Hedda Tesman; Gabler is her maiden name. On the subject
    of the title, Ibsen wrote: "My intention in giving it this name was to indicate
    that Hedda as a personality is to be regarded rather as her father's daughter
    than her husband's wife."

    Kiss Me, Kate is a musical with music and lyrics by Cole Porter. The story involves
    the production of a musical version of William Shakespeare's The Taming of the
    Shrew and the conflict on and off-stage between Fred Graham, the show's director,
    producer, and star, and his leading lady, his ex-wife Lilli Vanessi. A secondary
    romance concerns Lois Lane, the actress playing Bianca, and her gambler boyfriend,
    Bill, who runs afoul with some gangsters. The original production starred Alfred
    Drake, Patricia Morison, Lisa Kirk and Harold Lang and won the Tony-Award.

    Kiss Me, Kate was Porter's response to Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma! and
    other integrated musicals; it was the first show he wrote in which the music and
    lyrics were firmly connected to the script, and it proved to be his biggest hit
    and the only one of his shows to run for more than 1,000 performances on Broadway.
    In 1949, it won the first Tony Award presented for Best Musical.

    Carousel is the second musical by the team of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein
    II. The 1945 work was adapted from Ferenc Molnár's 1909 play Liliom, transplanting
    its Budapest setting to the Maine coastline. The story revolves around carousel
    barker Billy Bigelow, whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the
    price of both their jobs. He attempts a robbery to provide for Julie and their
    unborn child; after it goes wrong, he is given a chance to make things right.
    A secondary plot line deals with millworker Carrie Pipperidge and her romance
    with ambitious fisherman Enoch Snow. The show includes the well-known songs "If
    I Loved You", "June Is Bustin' Out All Over" and "You'll Never Walk Alone". Richard
    Rodgers later wrote that Carousel was his favorite of all his musicals.

    Following the spectacular success of the first Rodgers and Hammerstein musical,
    Oklahoma!, the pair sought to collaborate on another piece, knowing that any resulting
    work would be compared with Oklahoma!, most likely unfavorably. They were initially
    reluctant to seek the rights to Liliom; Molnár had refused permission for the
    work to be adapted in the past, and the original ending was considered too depressing
    for the musical theatre. After acquiring the rights, the team created a work with
    lengthy sequences of music and made the ending more hopeful.

    Pippin is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and a book by Roger
    O. Hirson. Bob Fosse, who directed the original Broadway production, also contributed
    to the libretto. The musical uses the premise of a mysterious performance troupe,
    led by a Leading Player, to tell the story of Pippin, a young prince on his search
    for meaning and significance.

    The protagonist, Pippin, and his father, Charlemagne, derive their characters
    from two real-life individuals of the early Middle Ages, though the plot presents
    very little historical accuracy regarding either. The show was partially financed
    by Motown Records. As of July 2011, Pippin is the 31st longest-running Broadway
    show. Pippin was originally conceived by Stephen Schwartz as Pippin, Pippin, a
    student musical performed by Carnegie Mellon's Scotch'n'Soda theatre troupe.

    According to musical theatre scholar Scott Miller in his 1996 book, From Assassins
    to West Side Story, "Pippin is a largely under-appreciated musical with a great
    deal more substance to it than many people realize...Because of its 1970s pop
    style score and a somewhat emasculated licensed version for amateur productions,
    which is very different from the original Broadway production, the show now has
    a reputation for being merely cute and harmlessly naughty; but if done the way
    director Bob Fosse envisioned it, the show is surreal and disturbing." Ben Vereen
    won a Tony Award for his portrayal of the Leading Player in the original Broadway
    production.

    Antony and Cleopatra is a tragedy by William Shakespeare. The play was first printed
    in the First Folio of 1623. The plot is based on Thomas North's translation of
    Plutarch's Lives and follows the relationship between Cleopatra and Mark Antony
    from the time of the Sicilian revolt to Cleopatra's suicide during the Final War
    of the Roman Republic. The major antagonist is Octavius Caesar, one of Antony's
    fellow triumviri and the future first emperor of Rome. The tragedy is a Roman
    play characterised by swift, panoramic shifts in geographical locations and in
    registers, alternating between sensual, imaginative Alexandria and the more pragmatic,
    austere Rome.

    Many consider the role of Cleopatra in this play one of the most complex female
    roles in Shakespeare's work. She is frequently vain and histrionic, provoking
    an audience almost to scorn; at the same time, Shakespeare's efforts invest both
    her and Antony with tragic grandeur. These contradictory features have led to
    famously divided critical responses.

    The Government Inspector, also known as The Inspector General, is a satirical
    play by the Ukrainian-born Russian dramatist and novelist Nikolai Gogol. Originally
    published in 1836, the play was revised for an 1842 edition. Based upon an anecdote
    allegedly recounted to Gogol by Pushkin, the play is a comedy of errors, satirizing
    human greed, stupidity, and the extensive political corruption of Imperial Russia.

    According to D. S. Mirsky, the play "is not only supreme in character and dialogue
    – it is one of the few Russian plays constructed with unerring art from beginning
    to end. The great originality of its plan consisted in the absence of all love
    interest and of sympathetic characters. The latter feature was deeply resented
    by Gogol's enemies, and as a satire the play gained immensely from it. There is
    not a wrong word or intonation from beginning to end, and the comic tension is
    of a quality that even Gogol did not always have at his beck and call."

    The dream-like scenes of the play, often mirroring each other, whirl in the endless
    vertigo of self-deception around the main character, Khlestakov, who personifies
    irresponsibility, light-mindedness, absence of measure. "He is full of meaningless
    movement and meaningless fermentation incarnate, on a foundation of placidly ambitious
    inferiority". The publication of the play led to a great outcry in the reactionary
    press. It took the personal intervention of Tsar Nicholas I to have the play staged,
    with Mikhail Shchepkin taking the role of the Mayor.

    Uncle Vanya is a play by the Russian playwright Anton Chekhov. It was first published
    in 1897 and received its Moscow première in 1899 in a production by the Moscow
    Art Theatre, under the direction of Konstantin Stanislavski.

    The play portrays the visit of an elderly Professor and his glamorous, much younger
    second wife, Yeléna, to the rural estate that supports their urban lifestyle.
    Two friends, Vanya, brother of the Professor's late first wife, who has long managed
    the estate, and Astrov, the local Doctor, both fall under Yelena's spell, while
    bemoaning the ennui of their provincial existence. Sonya, the Professor's daughter
    by his first wife, who has worked with Vanya to keep the estate going, meanwhile
    suffers from the awareness of her own lack of beauty and from her unrequited feelings
    for Dr. Astrov. Matters are brought to a crisis when the Professor announces his
    intention to sell the estate, Vanya and Sonya's home and raison d'être, with a
    view to investing the proceeds to achieve a higher income for himself and his

    The Seagull is the first of what are generally considered to be the four major
    plays by the Russian dramatist Anton Chekhov. The Seagull was written in 1895
    and first produced in 1896. It dramatises the romantic and artistic conflicts
    between four characters: the famous middlebrow story writer Boris Trigorin, the
    ingenue Nina, the fading actress Irina Arkadina, and her son the symbolist playwright
    Konstantin Tréplev.

    The character of Trigorin is considered Chekhov's greatest male role, though as
    with the rest of Chekhov's full-length plays, The Seagull relies upon an ensemble
    cast of diverse, fully developed characters. In contrast to the melodrama of the
    mainstream theatre of the 19th century, lurid actions are not shown onstage. Characters
    tend to speak in ways that skirt around issues rather than addressing them directly;
    in other words, their lines are full of what is known in dramatic practice as
    subtext, or text that is not spoken aloud.

    The opening night of the first production was a famous failure. Vera Komissarzhevskaya,
    playing Nina, was so intimidated by the hostility of the audience that she lost
    her voice. Chekhov left the audience and spent the last two acts behind the scenes.
    When supporters wrote to him that the production later became a success, he assumed
    that they were merely trying to be kind. When Constantin Stanislavski, the seminal
    Russian theatre practitioner of the time, directed it in 1898 for his Moscow Art
    Theatre, the play was a triumph. Stanislavski's production of The Seagull became
    "one of the greatest events in the history of Russian theatre and one of the greatest
    new developments in the history of world drama."

    The Lady of the Camellias is a novel by Alexandre Dumas, fils, first published
    in 1848, and subsequently adapted for the stage. The Lady of the Camellias premiered
    at the Théâtre du Vaudeville in Paris, France on February 2, 1852. The play was
    an instant success, and Giuseppe Verdi immediately set about putting the story
    to music. His work became the 1853 opera La Traviata, with the female protagonist,
    Marguerite Gautier, renamed Violetta Valéry.

    In the English-speaking world, The Lady of the Camellias became known as Camille
    and 16 versions have been performed at Broadway theatres alone. The title character
    is Marguerite Gautier, who is based on Marie Duplessis, the real-life lover of
    author Dumas, fils.

    Billy Elliot the Musical is a musical based on the 2000 film Billy Elliot. The
    music is by Elton John, and book and lyrics are by Lee Hall, who wrote the film's
    screenplay. The plot revolves around motherless Billy, who trades boxing gloves
    for ballet shoes. The story of his personal struggle and fulfillment are balanced
    against a counter-story of family and community strife caused by the UK miners'
    strike in County Durham, in North Eastern England. Hall's screenplay was inspired
    in part by A. J. Cronin's 1935 novel about a miners' strike, The Stars Look Down,
    to which the musical's opening song pays homage.

    The musical premiered in London's West End in 2005 and was nominated for nine
    Laurence Olivier Awards, winning four including Best New Musical. The production
    is still running strongly, and its success led to productions in Australia, on
    Broadway and elsewhere. In New York, it won ten Tony Awards and ten Drama Desk
    Awards, including, in each case, best musical. It has also won numerous awards
    in Australia including a record-tying seven Helpmann Awards.

    Lysistrata is one of the few surviving plays written by Aristophanes. Originally
    performed in classical Athens in 411 BC, it is a comic account of one woman's
    extraordinary mission to end The Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata persuades the women
    of Greece to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers as a means
    of forcing the men to negotiate peace — a strategy, however, that inflames the
    battle between the sexes. The play is notable for being an early exposé of sexual
    relations in a male-dominated society. The dramatic structure represents a shift
    away from the conventions of Old Comedy, a trend typical of the author's career.
    It was produced in the same year as Thesmophoriazusae, another play with a focus
    on gender-based issues, just two years after Athens' catastrophic defeat in the
    Sicilian Expedition.

    Annie Get Your Gun is a musical with lyrics and music written by Irving Berlin

    version of the life of Annie Oakley, a sharpshooter who starred in Buffalo Bill's
    Wild West Show, and her romance with sharpshooter Frank Butler.

    The 1946 Broadway production was a hit, and the musical had long runs in both
    New York and London, spawning revivals, a 1950 film version and television versions.
    Songs that became hits include "There's No Business Like Show Business", "Doin'

    Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a 1962 play by Edward Albee. It examines the
    breakdown of the marriage of a middle-aged couple, Martha and George. After a
    university faculty party, they receive an unwitting younger couple, Nick and Honey,
    as guests late one evening and draw them into their bitter and frustrated relationship.
    The play is in three acts, normally taking a little less than three hours to perform,
    with two 10-minute intermissions. The title is a pun on the song "Who's Afraid
    of the Big Bad Wolf?" from Walt Disney's The Three Little Pigs, substituting the
    name of the celebrated feminist English author Virginia Woolf. Martha and George
    repeatedly sing this version of the song throughout the play.

    Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? won both the 1963 Tony Award for Best Play and
    the 1962–'63 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Play. It is frequently
    revived on the modern stage. The film adaptation was released in 1966, written
    by Ernest Lehman, directed by Mike Nichols, and starring Richard Burton, Elizabeth
    Taylor, George Segal and Sandy Dennis.

    I, Don Quixote, which was in turn inspired by Miguel de Cervantes's seventeenth
    century masterpiece Don Quixote. It tells the story of the "mad" knight, Don Quixote,
    as a play within a play, performed by Cervantes and his fellow prisoners as he
    awaits a hearing with the Spanish Inquisition.

    The original 1965 Broadway production ran for 2,328 performances and won five
    Tony Awards, including Best Musical. The musical has been revived four times on
    Broadway, becoming one of the most enduring works of musical theatre.

    The principal song, "The Impossible Dream", became a standard. The musical has
    played in many other countries around the world, with productions in German, Hebrew,
    Japanese, Korean, Icelandic, Gujarati, Uzbek, Hungarian, Serbian, Slovenian, Swahili,
    Finnish, Ukrainian and nine distinctly different dialects of the Spanish language.

    Man of La Mancha was first performed at the Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut
    in 1965, and had its New York premiere on the thrust stage of the ANTA Washington
    Square Theatre in 1965.

    Cymbeline, also known as Cymbeline, King of Britain or The Tragedy of Cymbeline,
    is a play by William Shakespeare, based on legends concerning the early Celtic
    British King Cunobelinus. Although listed as a tragedy in the First Folio, modern
    critics often classify Cymbeline as a romance. Like Othello and The Winter's Tale,
    it deals with the themes of innocence and jealousy. While the precise date of
    composition remains unknown, the play was certainly produced as early as 1611.

    Measure for Measure is a play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written
    in 1603 or 1604. It was classified as comedy, but its mood defies those expectations.
    As a result and for a variety of reasons, some critics have labelled it as one
    of Shakespeare's problem plays. Originally published in the First Folio of 1623,
    the play's first recorded performance was in 1604. The play deals with the issues
    of mercy, justice, and truth and their relationship to pride and humility: "Some
    rise by sin, and some by virtue fall".

    La Cage aux Folles is a musical with a book by Harvey Fierstein and lyrics and
    music by Jerry Herman. Based on the 1973 French play of the same name by Jean
    Poiret, it focuses on a gay couple: Georges, the manager of a Saint-Tropez nightclub
    featuring drag entertainment, and Albin, his romantic partner and star attraction,
    and the farcical adventures that ensue when Georges's son, Jean-Michel, brings
    home his fiancée's ultra-conservative parents to meet them. La cage aux folles
    literally means "the cage of mad women". However folles is also a slang term for
    effeminate homosexuals.

    The original 1983 Broadway production received nine nominations for Tony Awards
    and won six, including Best Musical, Best Score and Best Book. The success of
    the musical spawned a West End production and several international runs. The
    2004 Broadway revival won the Tony Award for Best Revival, the 2008 London revival
    garnered the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival. The 2010 Broadway
    revival was nominated for eleven Tony Awards, winning the Tony Award for Best
    Revival of a Musical. La Cage aux Folles is the only musical which has won the
    Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical twice and the only show that has won
    a Best Production Tony Award for each of its Broadway productions. A National
    Tour, based on the 2010 revival, began in October 2011 with George Hamilton as
    Georges and Christopher Sieber as Albin.

    Blood Brothers is a musical with musics, lyrics and a book by Willy Russell, based
    loosely on the 1844 novella The Corsican Brothers by Alexandre Dumas. The story
    is a contemporary nature vs. nurture plot, revolving around fraternal twins who
    were separated at birth. The twins' different backgrounds take them to opposite
    ends of the social spectrum, one becoming a councillor and the other unemployed
    and in prison. They both fall in love with the same girl, causing a tear in their
    friendship and leading to the tragic deaths of both brothers.

    Originally developed as a school play, Blood Brothers debuted in Liverpool before
    Russell transferred it to West End for a short run in 1983. The musical won the
    Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical and went on to a year-long national
    tour before returning for a revival in the West End in 1988 where it stayed at
    the Noël Coward Theatre for 3 years.

    After transferring to the Phoenix Theatre in 1991, Blood Brothers spent more than
    24 years in the West End, and played more than 10,000 performances, becoming the
    third longest-running musical production in West End history. The West End revival
    closed in November 2012. The musical has been produced with success on tour, on
    Broadway and elsewhere, and it has developed a cult following.

    Next to Normal is a rock musical with book and lyrics by Brian Yorkey and music
    by Tom Kitt. Its story concerns a mother who struggles with worsening bipolar
    disorder and the effect that her illness has on her family. The musical also addresses
    such issues as grieving a loss, suicide, drug abuse, ethics in modern psychiatry,
    and suburban life.

    Next to Normal received several workshop performances before it debuted off-Broadway
    in 2008, winning the Outer Critics' Circle Award for Outstanding Score and receiving
    nominations for Drama Desk Awards for Outstanding Actress and Outstanding Score.
    After an Off-Broadway run, the show then played at the Arena Stage in its temporary
    venue in Washington, DC, from November 2008 to January 2009.

    The musical opened on Broadway in April 2009. It was nominated for eleven 2009
    Tony Awards and won three, Best Original Score, Best Orchestration and Best Performance
    by a Leading Actress in a Musical for Alice Ripley. It also won the 2010 Pulitzer
    Prize for Drama, becoming just the eighth musical in history to receive the honor.
    The previous musical to win the Pulitzer was Rent, in 1996, which was also directed
    by Michael Greif. In awarding the prize to Kitt and Yorkey, the Pulitzer Board
    called the show "a powerful rock musical that grapples with mental illness in
    a suburban family and expands the scope of subject matter for musicals."

    The Two Gentlemen of Verona is a comedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have
    been written in 1590 or 1591. It is considered by some to be Shakespeare's first
    play, and is often seen as showing his first tentative steps in laying out some
    of the themes and tropes with which he would later deal in more detail; for example,
    it is the first of his plays in which a heroine dresses as a boy. The play deals
    with the themes of friendship and infidelity, the conflict between friendship
    and love, and the foolish behaviour of people in love. The highlight of the play
    is considered by some to be Launce, the clownish servant of Proteus, and his dog
    Crab, to whom "the most scene-stealing non-speaking role in the canon" has been
    attributed.

    Two Gentlemen has the smallest cast of any play by Shakespeare and is commonly
    regarded as one of his weakest plays.

    The Winter's Tale is a play by William Shakespeare, originally published in the
    First Folio of 1623. Although it was grouped among the comedies, some modern editors
    have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeare's late romances. Some critics consider
    it to be one of Shakespeare's "problem plays", because the first three acts are
    filled with intense psychological drama, while the last two acts are comedic and
    supply a happy ending.

    Nevertheless, the play has been intermittently popular, revived in productions
    in various forms and adaptations by some of the leading theatre practitioners
    in Shakespearean performance history, beginning after a long interval with David
    Garrick in his adaptation called Florizel and Perdita. The Winter's Tale was revived
    again in the 19th century, when the third "pastoral" act was widely popular. In
    the second half of the 20th century The Winter's Tale in its entirety, and drawn
    largely from the First Folio text, was often performed, with varying degrees of
    success.

    The Oresteia is a trilogy of Greek tragedies written by Aeschylus which concerns
    the end of the curse on the House of Atreus. When originally performed it was
    accompanied by Proteus, a satyr play that would have been performed following
    the trilogy; it has not survived. The term "Oresteia" originally probably referred
    to all four plays, but today is generally used to designate only the surviving
    trilogy. "The individual plays probably did not originally have titles of their
    own" The only surviving example of a trilogy of ancient Greek plays, the Oresteia
    was originally performed at the Dionysia festival in Athens in 458 BC, where it
    won first prize. A principal theme of the trilogy is the shift from the practice
    of personal vendetta to a system of litigation. The name derives from the character
    Orestes, who sets out to avenge his father after his mother's affair with Aegisthus.

    Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is an absurdist, existentialist tragicomedy
    by Tom Stoppard, first staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1966. The play
    expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from Shakespeare's Hamlet, the
    courtiers Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. The action of Stoppard's play takes place
    mainly "in the wings" of Shakespeare's, with brief appearances of major characters
    from Hamlet who enact fragments of the original's scenes. Between these episodes
    the two protagonists voice their confusion at the progress of events of which—occurring
    onstage without them in Hamlet—they have no direct knowledge.

    The Producers is a musical adapted by Mel Brooks and Thomas Meehan from Brooks'
    1968 film of the same name, with lyrics written by Brooks and music composed by
    Brooks and arranged by Glen Kelly and Doug Besterman. As in the film, the story
    concerns two theatrical producers who scheme to get rich by overselling interests
    in a Broadway flop. The humor of the show draws on ridiculous accents, characters
    of homosexuals and Nazis, and many show business in-jokes.

    After 33 previews, the original Broadway production opened at the St. James Theatre
    on April 19, 2001, starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, and ran for 2,502
    performances, winning a record-breaking 12 Tony Awards. It spawned a successful
    London production running for just over two years, US national tours, many productions

    American Idiot is a one-act, through-sung stage musical, an adaptation of punk
    rock band Green Day's rock opera, American Idiot. After a run at the Berkeley
    Repertory Theatre in 2009, the show moved to the St. James Theatre on Broadway.
    Previews began on March 24, 2010 and the play officially opened on April 20, 2010.
    The show closed on April 24, 2011 after 422 performances. While Green Day did
    not appear in the production, vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong performed
    the role of "St. Jimmy" occasionally throughout the run.

    The story, expanded from that of the concept album, centers on three disaffected
    young men, Johnny, Will, and Tunny. Johnny and Tunny flee a stifling suburban
    lifestyle and parental restrictions, while Will stays home to work out his relationship
    with his pregnant girlfriend. The former pair look for meaning in life and try
    out the freedom and excitement of the city. Tunny quickly gives up on life in
    the city, joins the military, and is shipped off to war. Johnny finds a part of
    himself that he grows to dislike, has a relationship and experiences lost love.

    The book was written by Armstrong and director Michael Mayer. The music was composed
    by Green Day and the lyrics were by Armstrong. The score included all the songs
    from American Idiot and additional Green Day songs from other sources, including
    21st Century Breakdown, American Idiot b-sides, and a song called "When It's Time".

    Prometheus Bound is an Ancient Greek tragedy. In Antiquity, this drama was attributed
    to Aeschylus, but is now considered by some scholars to be the work of another
    hand, perhaps one as late as ca. 415 BC. Despite these doubts of authorship, the
    play's designation as Aeschylean has remained conventional. The tragedy is based
    on the myth of Prometheus, a Titan who was punished by the god Zeus for giving

    Company is a musical comedy based on a book by George Furth with music and lyrics
    by Stephen Sondheim. The original production was nominated for a record-setting
    fourteen Tony Awards and won six.

    Originally titled Threes, its plot revolves around Bobby, the five married couples
    who are his best friends, and his three girlfriends. Unlike most book musicals,
    which follow a clearly delineated plot, Company is a concept musical composed
    of short vignettes, presented in no particular chronological order, linked by
    a celebration for Bobby's 35th birthday.

    Company was among the first musicals to deal with adult themes and relationships.
    As Sondheim puts it, "Broadway theater has been for many years supported by upper-middle-class
    people with upper-middle-class problems. These people really want to escape that
    world when they go to the theatre, and then here we are with Company talking about
    how we're going to bring it right back in their faces."

    Henry V is a history play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written
    in approximately 1599. It tells the story of King Henry V of England, focusing
    on events immediately before and after the Battle of Agincourt during the Hundred
    Years' War. In the First Quarto text, it was entitled The Cronicle History of
    Henry the fift, which became The Life of Henry the Fifth in the First Folio text.

    The play is the final part of a tetralogy, preceded by Richard II, Henry IV, Part
    1 and Henry IV, Part 2. The original audiences would thus have already been familiar
    with the title character, who was depicted in the Henry IV plays as a wild, undisciplined
    lad known as "Prince Harry" and by Falstaff as "Hal". In Henry V, the young prince
    has become a mature man and embarks on a successful conquest of France.

    A Little Night Music is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and
    book by Hugh Wheeler. Inspired by the Ingmar Bergman film Smiles of a Summer Night,
    it involves the romantic lives of several couples. Its title is a literal English
    translation of the German name for Mozart's Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major,
    Eine kleine Nachtmusik. The musical includes the popular song "Send in the Clowns".

    Since its original 1973 Broadway production, the musical has enjoyed professional
    productions in the West End, by opera companies, in a 2009 Broadway revival, and
    elsewhere, and it is a popular choice for regional groups. It was adapted for
    film in 1977, with Harold Prince directing and Elizabeth Taylor, Len Cariou, Lesley-Anne
    Down and Diana Rigg starring.

    The Misanthrope, or the Cantankerous Lover is a 17th-century comedy of manners
    in verse written by Molière. It was first performed on 4 June 1666 at the Théâtre
    du Palais-Royal, Paris by the King's Players.

    The play satirizes the hypocrisies of French aristocratic society, but it also
    engages a more serious tone when pointing out the flaws which all humans possess.
    The play differs from other farces at the time by employing dynamic characters
    like Alceste and Célimène as opposed to the traditionally flat characters used
    by most satirists to criticize problems in society. It also differs from most
    of Molière's other works by focusing more on character development and nuances
    than on plot progression. The play, though not a commercial success in its time,
    survives as Molière's best known work today.

    Because both Tartuffe and Dom Juan, two of Molière's previous plays, had already
    been banned by the French government, Molière may have subdued his actual ideas
    to make his play more socially acceptable. As a result, there is much uncertainty
    about whether the main character Alceste is supposed to be perceived as a hero
    for his strong standards of honesty or whether he is supposed to be perceived
    as a fool for having such idealistic and unrealistic views about society. Molière
    has received much criticism for The Misanthrope. The French philosopher Jean-Jacques
    Rousseau, claimed that it was Molière's best work but hated the fact that Alceste
    was depicted as a fool on stage. He believed that the audience should be supporting
    Alceste and his views about society rather than disregarding his idealistic notions
    and belittling him as a character.

    Henry IV, Part 1 is a history play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been
    written no later than 1597. It is the second play in Shakespeare's tetralogy dealing
    with the successive reigns of Richard II, Henry IV, and Henry V. Henry IV, Part
    1 depicts a span of history that begins with Hotspur's battle at Homildon against
    the Douglas late in 1402 and ends with the defeat of the rebels at Shrewsbury
    in the middle of 1403. From the start it has been an extremely popular play both
    with the public and the critics.

    Sunset Boulevard is a musical with book and lyrics by Don Black and Christopher
    Hampton and music by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Based on the 1950 film of the same title,
    the plot revolves around Norma Desmond, a faded star of the silent screen era,
    living in the past in her decaying mansion on the fabled Los Angeles street. When
    young screenwriter Joe Gillis accidentally crosses her path, she sees in him an
    opportunity to make her comeback to the big screen. Romance and tragedy follow.

    Opening first in London in 1993, the musical has had several long runs internationally
    and also enjoyed extensive tours, although the show, which has been the subject
    of several legal battles, lost money because of its extraordinary running costs.

    The Bacchae is an ancient Greek tragedy by the Athenian playwright Euripides,
    during his final years in Macedonia, at the court of Archelaus I of Macedon. It
    premièred posthumously at the Theatre of Dionysus in 405 BC as part of a tetralogy
    that also included Iphigeneia at Aulis and Alcmaeon in Corinth, and which Euripides'
    son or nephew probably directed. It won first prize in the City Dionysia festival
    competition.

    The tragedy is based on the mythological story of King Pentheus of Thebes and
    his mother Agauë, and their punishment by the god Dionysus for refusing to worship
    him.

    series, as well as other derivative works and spin-offs. The plot concerns two
    mismatched roommates: the neat, uptight Felix Ungar and the slovenly, easygoing
    Oscar Madison. Simon adapted the play in 1985 to feature a pair of female roommates
    in The Female Odd Couple. An updated version of the 1965 show appeared in 2002
    with the title Oscar and Felix: A New Look at the Odd Couple.

    Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark is a 2011 rock musical with music and lyrics by
    U2's Bono and The Edge and a book by Julie Taymor, Glen Berger, and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa.
    The musical is based on the Spider-Man comics created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko,
    published by Marvel Comics, as well as the 2002 film about the character, and
    the Greek myth of Arachne. It tells the story of the origin of the character,
    his romance with Mary Jane and his battles with the evil Green Goblin. The show
    includes highly technical stunts, such as actors swinging from "webs" and several
    aerial combat scenes.

    In the year before it premiered, the show gained notoriety for its production
    troubles, related to both the difficulty of its stunts and frequent retooling
    of the book and score. Both rehearsals and previews went on longer than expected,
    and several actors were injured during the process. At the first preview performance,
    these technical challenges caused several lengthy interruptions. Previews were
    then suspended for a month in mid-2011 to overhaul the show after negative reviews
    from preview audiences and critics. Director Julie Taymor, whose vision had driven
    the musical, left the production at that time, and co-director Philip William
    McKinley was brought in to redirect portions of the show. The show ended up having
    the longest preview period in history.

    A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is a musical with music and lyrics
    by Stephen Sondheim and book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart.

    Inspired by the farces of the ancient Roman playwright Plautus, specifically Pseudolus,
    Miles Gloriosus and Mostellaria, the musical tells the bawdy story of a slave
    named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master
    woo the girl next door. The plot displays many classic elements of farce, including
    puns, the slamming of doors, cases of mistaken identity, and satirical comments
    on social class. The title derives from the line that vaudeville comedians often
    used to begin a story: "A funny thing happened on the way to the theater".

    The musical's original 1962 Broadway run won several Tony Awards, including Best
    Musical and Best Book. A Funny Thing has enjoyed several Broadway and West End
    revivals and was made into a successful film starring the original lead of the
    musical, Zero Mostel.

    Equus is a play by Peter Shaffer written in 1973, telling the story of a psychiatrist
    who attempts to treat a young man who has a pathological religious fascination
    with horses.

    Shaffer was inspired to write Equus when he heard of a crime involving a 17-year-old
    who blinded six horses in a small town near Suffolk. He set out to construct a
    fictional account of what might have caused the incident, without knowing any
    of the details of the crime. The play's action is something of a detective story,
    involving the attempts of the child psychiatrist, Dr. Martin Dysart, to understand
    the cause of the boy's actions while wrestling with his own sense of purpose.
    The stage show ran in London between 1973 and 1975: later came the Broadway productions
    that starred Anthony Hopkins as Dysart, and from the London production, Peter
    Firth as Alan. The Broadway production ran for 1,209 performances.

    However, numerous other issues inform the narrative. Most important are religious
    and ritual sacrifice themes, and the manner in which character Alan Strang constructs
    a personal theology involving the horses and the supreme godhead, "Equus". Alan
    sees the horses as representative of God and confuses his adoration of his "God"
    with sexual attraction. Also important is Shaffer's examination of the conflict
    between personal values and satisfaction and societal mores, expectations and
    institutions. In reference to the play's classical structure, themes and characterization,
    Shaffer has discussed the conflict between Apollonian and Dionysian values and
    systems in human life.

    The Imaginary Invalid is a three-act comédie-ballet by the French playwright Molière
    with dance sequences and musical interludes by Marc-Antoine Charpentier. It premiered
    on 10 February 1673 at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in Paris and was originally
    choreographed by Pierre Beauchamp.

    Molière had fallen out with the powerful court composer Jean-Baptiste Lully, with
    whom he had pioneered the comédie-ballet form a decade earlier, and had opted
    for the collaboration with Charpentier, Lully's rival and arguably a more gifted
    composer. Le malade imaginaire would turn out to be Molière's last work. He collapsed
    during his fourth performance as Argan on 17 February and died soon after.

    The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus, commonly referred
    to simply as Doctor Faustus, is a play by Christopher Marlowe, based on the Faust
    story, in which a man sells his soul to the devil for power and knowledge. Doctor
    Faustus was first published in 1604, eleven years after Marlowe's death and at
    least twelve years after the first performance of the play.

    "No Elizabethan play outside the Shakespeare canon has raised more controversy
    than Doctor Faustus. There is no agreement concerning the nature of the text and
    the date of composition... and the centrality of the Faust legend in the history
    of the Western world precludes any definitive agreement on the interpretation
    of the play..."

    Woyzeck is a stage play written by Georg Büchner. He left the work incomplete
    at his death, but it has been variously and posthumously "finished" by a variety
    of authors, editors and translators. Woyzeck has become one of the most performed
    and influential plays in the German theatre repertory.

    Büchner probably began writing the play between June and September 1836. It remained
    in a fragmentary state at the time of his early death in 1837. Woyzeck was first
    published in 1879 in a heavily reworked version by Karl Emil Franzos. It received
    its first performance on November 8, 1913 at the Residenztheater, Munich.

    Woyzeck deals with the dehumanising effects of doctors and the military on a young
    man's life. It is often seen as 'working class' tragedy, though it can also be
    viewed as having another dimension, portraying the 'perennial tragedy of human
    jealousy'. The play was admired both by the German naturalist Gerhart Hauptmann
    and, subsequently, by expressionist playwrights. It is loosely based on the true
    story of Johann Christian Woyzeck, a Leipzig wigmaker who later became a soldier.
    In 1821, Woyzeck, in a fit of jealousy, murdered Christiane Woost, a widow with
    whom he had been living. He was later publicly beheaded.

    The Comedy of Errors is one of William Shakespeare's earliest plays. It is his
    shortest and one of his most farcical comedies, with a major part of the humour
    coming from slapstick and mistaken identity, in addition to puns and word play.
    The Comedy of Errors is one of only two of Shakespeare's plays to observe the
    classical unities. It has been adapted for opera, stage, screen and musical theatre.

    The Comedy of Errors tells the story of two sets of identical twins that were
    accidentally separated at birth. Antipholus of Syracuse and his servant, Dromio
    of Syracuse, arrive in Ephesus, which turns out to be the home of their twin brothers,
    Antipholus of Ephesus and his servant, Dromio of Ephesus. When the Syracusans
    encounter the friends and families of their twins, a series of wild mishaps based
    on mistaken identities lead to wrongful beatings, a near-seduction, the arrest
    of Antipholus of Ephesus, and false accusations of infidelity, theft, madness,
    and demonic possession.

    The Drowsy Chaperone is a musical with book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar and

    musical comedy of the 1920s. The story concerns a middle-aged, asocial musical
    theatre fan; as he plays the record of his favorite musical, the 1928 hit The
    Drowsy Chaperone, the show comes to life onstage as he wryly comments on the music,
    story, and actors. The Drowsy Chaperone debuted in 1998 at The Rivoli in Toronto
    and opened on Broadway on 1 May 2006. The show won the Tony Award for Best Book

    Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up or Peter and Wendy is J. M. Barrie's
    most famous work, in the form of a 1904 play and a 1911 novel, respectively. Both
    versions tell the story of Peter Pan, a mischievous little boy who can fly, and
    his adventures on the island of Neverland with Wendy Darling and her brothers,
    the fairy Tinker Bell, the Lost Boys, the Indian princess Tiger Lily, and the
    pirate Captain Hook. The play and novel were inspired by Barrie's friendship with
    the Llewelyn Davies family. Barrie continued to revise the play for years after
    its debut; the novel reflects one version of the story.

    The play debuted in London on 27 December 1904 with Nina Boucicault, daughter
    of playwright Dion Boucicault, in the title role. A Broadway production was mounted
    in 1905 starring Maude Adams. It was later revived with such actresses as Marilyn
    Miller and Eva Le Gallienne. The play has since seen adaptation as a pantomime,
    stage musical, a television special, and several films, including a 1924 silent
    film, a 1953 animated Disney full-length feature, and a 2003 live action production.
    The play is now rarely performed in its original form on stage in the United Kingdom,
    whereas pantomime adaptations are frequently staged around Christmas. In the U.S.,
    the original version has also been supplanted in popularity by the 1954 musical
    version, which became popular on television.

    Mary Poppins is a musical with music and lyrics by the Academy Award-winning Sherman
    Brothers and a book by Julian Fellowes. The musical is based on the similarly
    titled series of children's books by P. L. Travers and the 1964 Disney film, and
    is a fusion of various elements from the two. Some elements from the books that
    had been omitted from the film were restored, such as the walking statue and the
    ladders rising to the stars. Others were removed, such as the scene in which Uncle
    Albert gets caught on the ceiling, laughing.

    Produced by Walt Disney Theatrical and directed by Richard Eyre with co-direction
    from Matthew Bourne who also acted as co-choreographer with Stephen Mear, the
    original West End production opened in December 2004 and received two Olivier
    Awards, one for Best Actress in a Musical and the other for Best Theatre Choreography.
    A Broadway production with a near-identical creative team opened in November 2006,
    with only minor changes from the West End version. It received seven Tony Award
    nominations, including Best Musical, winning for Best Scenic Design.

    Brigadoon is a musical with a book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by
    Frederick Loewe. Songs from the musical, such as "Almost Like Being in Love" have
    become standards. The story involves two American tourists who stumble upon Brigadoon,
    a mysterious Scottish village that appears for only one day every hundred years.
    Tommy, one of the tourists, falls in love with Fiona, a young woman from Brigadoon.

    The original production opened on Broadway in 1947 and ran for 581 performances.
    It starred David Brooks, George Keane, and Marion Bell. Brigadoon then received
    a West End production opening in 1949 that ran for 685 performances, and many
    revivals followed. A 1954 film version starred Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse. A
    1966 television version starred Robert Goulet and Peter Falk.

    Bye Bye Birdie is a stage musical with a book by Michael Stewart, lyrics by Lee
    Adams, and music by Charles Strouse.

    Originally titled Let's Go Steady, the satire on American society is set in 1958.
    The story was inspired by the phenomenon of popular singer Elvis Presley and his
    draft notice into the Army in 1957. The rock star character's name, "Conrad Birdie,"
    is word play on the name of Conway Twitty. Twitty is best remembered today for
    his long career as a country music star, but in the late 1950s, he was one of
    Presley's rock 'n' roll rivals.

    The original Broadway production was a Tony Award-winning success. It spawned
    a London production and several major revivals, a sequel, a 1963 film and a 1995
    television production. The show also became a popular choice for high school and
    college productions.

    Funny Girl is a musical with a book by Isobel Lennart, music by Jule Styne, and
    lyrics by Bob Merrill. The semi-biographical plot is based on the life and career
    of Broadway, film star and comedienne Fanny Brice and her stormy relationship
    with entrepreneur and gambler Nick Arnstein. Its original title was My Man.

    The musical was produced by Ray Stark, who was Brice's son-in-law via his marriage
    to her daughter Frances, and starred Barbra Streisand. The production was nominated
    for eight Tony Awards but, facing tough competition from Hello, Dolly!, it failed
    to win in any categories.

    Mother Courage and Her Children is a play written in 1939 by the German dramatist
    and poet Bertolt Brecht with significant contributions from Margarete Steffin.
    After four very important theatrical productions in Switzerland and Germany from
    1941 to 1952—the last three supervised and/or directed by Brecht—the play was
    filmed several years after Brecht's death in 1959/1960 with Brecht's widow and
    leading actress, Helene Weigel.

    Mother Courage is considered by some to be the greatest play of the 20th century,
    and perhaps also the greatest anti-war play of all time.

    Sweet Charity is a musical with music by Cy Coleman, lyrics by Dorothy Fields
    and book by Neil Simon. It was directed and choreographed for Broadway by Bob
    Fosse starring his wife and muse Gwen Verdon alongside John McMartin. It is based
    on Federico Fellini's screenplay for Nights of Cabiria. However, where Fellini's
    black-and-white Italian film concerns the romantic ups-and-downs of an ever-hopeful
    prostitute, in the musical the central character is a dancer-for-hire at a Times
    Square dance hall. The musical premiered on Broadway in 1966, where it was nominated
    for 12 Tony Awards, and also ran in the West End as well as having revivals and
    international productions.

    The movie/show was adapted for the screen in 1969 with Shirley MacLaine as Charity
    and John McMartin recreating his Broadway role as Oscar Lindquist. Bob Fosse directed
    and choreographed this film.

    Our Town is a 1938 three-act play by American playwright Thornton Wilder. Set
    in the fictional American small town of Grover's Corners, it tells the story of
    an average town's citizens in the early twentieth century as depicted through
    their everyday lives. Scenes from the town's history between the years of 1901
    and 1913 are performed. The play is performed without a set and the actors mime
    their actions without the use of props. Throughout Wilder uses metatheatrical
    devices, such as narration by a stage manager.

    Our Town was first performed at McCarter Theater in Princeton, New Jersey on January
    22, 1938. It later went on to success on Broadway and won the Pulitzer Prize for
    Drama. It remains popular today and revivals are frequent.

    Sunday in the Park with George is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim
    and book by James Lapine. The musical was inspired by the painting "A Sunday Afternoon
    on the Island of La Grande Jatte" by Georges Seurat. A complex work revolving
    around a fictionalized Seurat immersed in single-minded concentration while painting
    his masterpiece and the people in that picture, the Broadway production opened
    to mixed reviews in 1984.

    The musical won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, two Tony Awards for design,
    numerous Drama Desk Awards, the 1991 Olivier Award for Best Musical and the 2007
    Olivier Award for Outstanding Musical Production. It has enjoyed several major

    Nathan the Wise is a play published by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in 1779. It is
    a fervent plea for religious tolerance. Its performance was forbidden by the church
    during Lessing's lifetime; it was first performed in 1783 in Berlin. In 1922 it
    was adapted into a silent film of the same title.

    Set in Jerusalem during the Third Crusade, it describes how the wise Jewish merchant
    Nathan, the enlightened sultan Saladin, and the Templar bridge their gaps between
    Judaism, Islam and Christianity. Its major themes are friendship, tolerance, relativism
    of God, a rejection of miracles and a need for communication.

    Le Bourgeois gentilhomme is a five-act comédie-ballet—a play intermingled with
    music, dance and singing—by Molière, first presented on 14 October 1670 before
    the court of Louis XIV at the Château of Chambord by Molière's troupe of actors.
    Subsequent public performances were given at the theatre of the Palais-Royal beginning
    on 23 November 1670. The music was composed by Jean-Baptiste Lully, the choreography
    was by Pierre Beauchamp, the sets were by Carlo Vigarani and the costumes were
    done by the chevalier d’Arvieux.

    Le Bourgeois gentilhomme satirizes attempts at social climbing and the bourgeois
    personality, poking fun both at the vulgar, pretentious middle-class and the vain,
    snobbish aristocracy. The title is meant as an oxymoron: in Molière's France,
    a "gentleman" was by definition nobly born, and thus there could be no such thing
    as a bourgeois gentleman. The play is in prose.

    Priscilla, Queen of the Desert is a musical with a book by Australian film director-writer
    Stephan Elliott and Allan Scott, using well-known pop songs as its score. Adapted
    from Elliott's 1994 film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, the
    musical tells the story of two drag queens and a transsexual, who contract to
    perform a drag show at a resort in Alice Springs, a resort town in the remote
    Australian desert. As they head west from Sydney aboard their lavender bus, Priscilla,
    the three friends come to the forefront of a comedy of errors, encountering a
    number of strange characters, as well as incidents of homophobia, while widening
    comfort zones and finding new horizons.

    Produced by Allan Scott in coalition with Back Row Productions, Michael Chugg,
    Michael Hamlyn and John Frost, the Simon Phillips-directed and Ross Coleman-choreographed
    original production of Priscilla debuted in Australia at the Lyric Theatre, Sydney
    in October 2006. Having had a successful run in Sydney, the production transferred
    to Melbourne in 2007 and then New Zealand in 2008, before returning to Sydney
    for a limited engagement for its second anniversary. The Australian success of
    Priscilla provoked a two year strong West End production in addition to its Bette
    Midler-produced Broadway debut in 2011. While the original production received
    one out of its seven Helpmann Award nominations, Priscilla was nominated for the
    Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical as well as two Tony Awards, winning
    these awards in the costume design categories.

    The Fantasticks is a 1960 musical with music by Harvey Schmidt and lyrics by Tom
    Jones. It tells an allegorical story, loosely based on the play "The Romancers"
    by Edmond Rostand, concerning two neighboring fathers who trick their children,
    Luisa and Matt, into falling in love by pretending to feud. The fathers hire traveling
    actors to stage a mock abduction, so that Matt can heroically seem to save Luisa,
    ending the supposed feud. When the children discover the deception, they reject
    the arranged love match and separate. Each then gains disillusioning experiences
    of the real world, seen in parallel fantasy sequences. They return to each other
    bruised but enlightened, and they renew their vows with more maturity.

    The show's original off-Broadway production ran a total of 42 years and 17,162
    performances, making it the world's longest-running musical. The musical was produced
    by Lore Noto. It was awarded Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre in 1991. The
    poetic book and breezy, inventive score, including such familiar songs as "Try
    to Remember," helped make this show so durable. Many productions followed, as
    well as television and film versions. The Fantasticks has also become a staple
    of regional, community, and high school productions virtually since its premiere,
    with approximately 250 new productions each year. It is played with a small cast,
    two to three-person orchestra and minimalist set design. Among many revivals,
    the show re-opened off-Broadway in 2006. As of 2010, its original investors have
    earned 240 times their original investments. The musical has played throughout
    the U.S. and in at least 67 foreign countries.

    Glengarry Glen Ross is a play by David Mamet that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1984.
    The play shows parts of two days in the lives of four desperate Chicago real estate
    agents who are prepared to engage in any number of unethical, illegal acts—from
    lies and flattery to bribery, threats, intimidation and burglary—to sell undesirable
    real estate to unwitting prospective buyers. The play draws partly on Mamet's
    experiences in a Chicago real estate office, where he worked briefly in the late
    1960s. The title of the play comes from the names of two of the real estate developments,
    Glengarry Highlands and Glen Ross Farms, being peddled by the salesmen characters.

    The world premiere was at the National Theatre in London on September 21, 1983,
    where Bill Bryden's production in the Cottesloe was acclaimed as a triumph of
    ensemble acting.

    The play opened on Broadway on March 25, 1984 and closed on February 17, 1985.
    The production was directed by Gregory Mosher and starred Joe Mantegna, Mike Nussbaum,
    Robert Prosky, Lane Smith, James Tolkan, Jack Wallace and J. T. Walsh. The production
    was nominated for four Tony awards including Best Play, Best Director, and two
    Best Featured Actor nominations for Robert Prosky and Joe Mantegna, who won the
    production's one Tony.

    she takes against her husband Jason who has betrayed her for another woman. Euripides
    produced Medea along with the lost plays Philoctetes, Dictys and the satyr play

    The original 1960 production, directed by Moss Hart and orchestrated by Robert

    four Tony Awards and spawning several revivals, foreign productions and a 1967
    film version. The original cast album was America's top-selling LP for 60 weeks.

    Follies is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by James
    Goldman. The story concerns a reunion in a crumbling Broadway theatre, scheduled
    for demolition, of the past performers of the "Weismann's Follies," a musical
    revue, that played in that theatre between the World Wars. It focuses on two couples,
    Buddy and Sally Durant Plummer and Benjamin and Phyllis Rogers Stone, who are
    attending the reunion. Sally and Phyllis were showgirls in the Follies. Both couples
    are deeply unhappy with their marriages. Buddy, a traveling salesman, is having
    an affair with a girl on the road; Sally is still as much in love with Ben as
    she was years ago; and Ben is so self-absorbed that Phyllis feels emotionally
    abandoned. Several of the former showgirls perform their old numbers, sometimes
    accompanied by the ghosts of their former selves.

    The Broadway production opened on April 4, 1971, directed by Harold Prince and
    Michael Bennett, and with choreography by Bennett. The musical was nominated for
    eleven Tony Awards and won seven. The original production, which ultimately lost
    its entire investment, ran for 522 performances. The piece has enjoyed a number
    of major revivals, and several of its songs have become standards, including "Broadway
    Baby", "I'm Still Here", "Too Many Mornings", "Could I Leave You?", and "Losing
    My Mind".

    No Exit is a 1944 existentialist French play by Jean-Paul Sartre. The original
    title is the French equivalent of the legal term in camera, referring to a private
    discussion behind closed doors; English translations have also been performed
    under the titles In Camera, No Way Out, Vicious Circle, Behind Closed Doors, and
    Dead End. The play was first performed at the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier in May
    1944.

    It is a depiction of the afterlife in which three deceased characters are punished
    by being locked into a room together for eternity, and is the source of one of
    Sartre's most famous and most often misinterpreted quotations, l'enfer, c'est
    les autres, a reference to Sartre's ideas about the Look, and the constant ontological
    struggle of being caused to see oneself as an object in the world of another consciousness.

    – a thoroughly modern aim in 1922, when women were just entering the workforce.
    Millie soon begins to take delight in the flapper lifestyle, but problems arise
    when she checks into a hotel owned by the leader of a white slavery ring in China.
    The style of the musical is comic pastiche. Like the film on which it is based,
    it interpolates new tunes with some previously written songs.

    After try-outs at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego, California in October 2000,
    the show opened on Broadway in April 2002. The production subsequently won six
    2002 Tony Awards, including Best Musical. Due to the success of the original Broadway
    production, there were both a United States tour and a West End production launched
    in 2003, followed by a United Kingdom tour in 2005. The musical has since become
    a popular choice for high school productions.

    A stage musical based on the 1980 musical film Fame has been staged under two
    titles. The first, 'Fame – The Musical' conceived and developed by David De Silva,
    is a musical with a book by Jose Fernandez, music by Steve Margoshes and lyrics
    by Jacques Levy. The musical premiered in 1988 in Miami, Florida. as 'Fame on
    42nd Street', it was performed Off-Broadway from 2003 to 2004.

    De Silva had produced the 1980 film about students at New York City's High School
    of Performing Arts. The critically and commercially successful film was followed
    by a six-season television series, and the musical. The musical is significantly
    rewritten from the previous adaptations, with an almost entirely new score. The
    film is referred to several times in the script and in two songs.

    It tells the story of several students who attend the High School of Performing
    Arts, among them fame-obsessed drug addict Carmen, ambitious actress Serena, wisecracking
    comedian Joe, quiet, saintly violinist Schlomo, and "talented but dyslexic" dancer
    Tyrone.

    Since its first production, Fame – The Musical has had hundreds of professional
    and amateur productions in almost every language.

    Mame is a musical with the book by Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee and music
    and lyrics by Jerry Herman. Originally titled My Best Girl, it is based on the
    1955 novel Auntie Mame by Patrick Dennis and a 1956 Broadway play, by Lawrence
    and Lee, that starred Rosalind Russell. Set in New York and spanning the Great
    Depression and World War II, it focuses on eccentric bohemian, Mame Dennis, whose
    famous motto is "Life is a banquet and most poor sons of bitches are starving
    to death." Her fabulous life with her wealthy friends is interrupted when the
    young son of her late brother arrives to live with her. They cope with the Depression
    in a series of adventures.

    In 1958, a film titled Auntie Mame, based on the play, was released by Warner
    Brothers once again starring Rosalind Russell in the title role. Russell was nominated
    for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe for her portrayal.

    The musical opened on Broadway in 1966, starring Angela Lansbury and Beatrice
    Arthur. The production became a hit and spawned a 1974 film with Lucille Ball
    in the title role and Arthur reprising her supporting role, as well as a London
    production, a Broadway revival, and a 40th anniversary revival at the Kennedy
    Center in 2006.

    King Richard the Second is a history play by William Shakespeare believed to have
    been written in approximately 1595. It is based on the life of King Richard II
    of England and is the first part of a tetralogy, referred to by some scholars
    as the Henriad, followed by three plays concerning Richard's successors: Henry
    IV, Part 1; Henry IV, Part 2; and Henry V. It may not have been written as a stand-alone
    work.

    Although the First Folio edition of Shakespeare's works lists the play as a history
    play, the earlier Quarto edition of 1597 calls it The tragedie of King Richard
    the second.

    Noises Off is a 1982 play by the English playwright Michael Frayn. The idea for
    it came in 1970, when Frayn was watching from the wings a performance of The Two
    of Us, a farce that he had written for Lynn Redgrave. He said, "It was funnier
    from behind than in front, and I thought that one day I must write a farce from
    behind." The prototype, a short-lived one-act play called Exits, was written and
    performed in 1977. At the request of his associate, Michael Codron, Frayn expanded
    this into what would become Noises Off. It takes its title from the theatrical
    stage direction indicating sounds coming from offstage.

    The Duchess of Malfi is a macabre, tragic play written by the English dramatist
    John Webster in 1612–13. It was first performed privately at the Blackfriars Theatre,
    then before a more general audience at The Globe, in 1613-14. Published in 1623,
    the play is loosely based on events that occurred between about 1508 and 1513,
    recounted in William Painter's The Palace of Pleasure. The Duchess was Giovanna
    d'Aragona, whose father, Arrigo d'Aragona, Marquis of Gerace, was an illegitimate
    son of Ferdinand I of Naples. Her husbands were Alfonso Piccolomini, Duke of Amalfi,
    and Antonio Bologna.

    The play begins as a love story, with a Duchess who marries beneath her class,
    and ends as a nightmarish tragedy as her two brothers exact their revenge, destroying
    themselves in the process.

    Jacobean drama continued the trend of stage violence and horror set by Elizabethan
    tragedy, under the influence of Seneca, and there is a great deal of all that
    in the later scenes of the play. The complexity of some of its characters, particularly
    Bosola and the Duchess, plus Webster's poetic language, ensure the play is often
    considered among the greatest tragedies of English renaissance drama.

    Le Cid is a tragicomedy written by Pierre Corneille and published in 1636. It
    is based on the legend of El Cid.

    The play followed Corneille's first true tragedy, Médée, produced in 1635. An
    enormous popular success, Corneille's Le Cid was the subject of a heated polemic
    over the norms of dramatic practice known as the Querelle du Cid. Cardinal Richelieu's
    Académie française acknowledged the play's success, but determined that it was
    defective, in part because it did not respect the classical unities.

    All's Well That Ends Well is a play by William Shakespeare. It is traditionally
    believed to have been written between 1604 and 1605, and was originally published
    in the First Folio in 1623.

    Though originally the play was classified as one of Shakespeare's comedies, the
    play is now considered by some critics to be one of his problem plays, so named
    because they cannot be neatly classified as tragedy or comedy.

    The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee is a long one-act musical comedy conceived
    by Rebecca Feldman with music and lyrics by William Finn, a book by Rachel Sheinkin
    and additional material by Jay Reiss. The show centers on a fictional spelling
    bee set in a geographically ambiguous Putnam Valley Middle School. Six quirky
    adolescents compete in the Bee, run by three equally-quirky grown-ups.

    The 2005 Broadway production, directed by James Lapine and produced by David Stone,
    James L. Nederlander, Barbara Whitman, Patrick Catullo, Barrington Stage Company
    and Second Stage Theater, earned good reviews and box-office success and was nominated
    for six Tony Awards, winning two, including Best Book. The show has spawned various
    other productions in the U.S., including a national tour with performances in
    Canada, and Australian productions.

    An unusual aspect of the show is that four real audience members are invited on
    stage to compete in the spelling bee alongside the six young characters. During
    the 2005 Tony Awards, former Presidential candidate Al Sharpton competed. Another
    amusing aspect of the show is that the official pronouncer, usually an improv
    comedian, provides ridiculous usage-in-a-sentence examples when asked to use words
    in a sentence. For instance, for the word "palaestra," he says, "Euripides said,
    'What happens at the palaestra stays at the palaestra.'" At some shows, adult-only
    audiences are invited for "Parent-Teacher Conferences," also known as "adult night
    at the Bee." These performances are peppered with sexual references and profanity
    inspired by R-rated ad-libs made during rehearsals.

    Miss Julie is a naturalistic play written in 1888 by August Strindberg dealing
    with class, love, lust, the battle of the sexes, and the interaction among them.
    Set on Midsummer's Eve on the estate of a Count in Sweden, the young woman of
    the title, attempting to escape an existence cramped by social mores and have
    a little fun, dances at the servants' annual midsummer party, where she is drawn
    to a senior servant, a footman named Jean, who is particularly well-traveled,
    well-mannered and well-read. The action takes place in the kitchen of Miss Julie's
    father's manor; here Jean's fiancée, a servant named Kristin, cooks and sometimes
    sleeps while Jean and Miss Julie talk.

    The plot is primarily concerned with power in its various forms. Miss Julie has
    power over Jean because she is upper-class. Jean has power over Miss Julie because
    he is male and uninhibited by aristocratic values. The count, Miss Julie's father,
    has power over both of them since he is a nobleman, an employer, and a father.

    On this night, behavior between Miss Julie and Jean which was previously a flirtatious
    contest for power rapidly escalates to a love relationship—or is it just lust?—that
    is fully consummated. Over the course of the play, Miss Julie and Jean battle
    for control, which swings back and forth between them until Jean convinces her
    that the only way to escape her predicament is to commit suicide.

    The Good Person of Szechwan is a play written by the German theatre practitioner
    Bertolt Brecht, in collaboration with Margarete Steffin and Ruth Berlau. The play
    was begun in 1938 but not completed until 1943, while the author was in exile
    in the United States. It was first performed in 1943 at the Zürich Schauspielhaus
    in Switzerland, with a musical score and songs by Swiss composer Huldreich Georg
    Früh. Today, Paul Dessau's composition of the songs from 1947–48, also authorized
    by Brecht, is the better known version. The play is an example of Brecht's "non-Aristotelian
    drama", a dramatic form intended to be staged with the methods of epic theatre.
    The play is a parable set in the Chinese "city of Sichuan".

    The Trojan Women, also known as Troades, is a tragedy by the Greek playwright
    Euripides. Produced in 415 BC during the Peloponnesian War, it is often considered
    a commentary on the capture of the Aegean island of Melos and the subsequent slaughter
    and subjugation of its populace by the Athenians earlier that year. 415 BC was
    also the year of the scandalous desecration of the hermai and the Athenians' second
    expedition to Sicily, events which may also have influenced the author.

    The Trojan Women was the third tragedy of a trilogy of dealing with the Trojan
    War. The first tragedy, Alexandros, was about the recognition of the Trojan prince
    Paris who had been abandoned in infancy by his parents and rediscovered in adulthood.
    The second tragedy, Palamedes, dealt with Greek mistreatment of their fellow Greek
    Palamedes. This trilogy was presented at the Dionysia along with the comedic satyr
    play Sisyphos. The plots of this trilogy were not connected in the way that Aeschylus'
    Oresteia was connected. Euripides did not favor such connected trilogies.

    Euripides won second prize at the City Dionysia for his effort, losing to the
    obscure tragedian Xenocles.
