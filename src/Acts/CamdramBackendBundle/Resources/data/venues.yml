    The Royal Opera House is an opera house and major performing arts venue in Covent
    Garden, central London. The large building is often referred to as simply "Covent
    Garden", after a previous use of the site of the opera house's original construction
    in 1732. It is the home of The Royal Opera, The Royal Ballet, and the Orchestra
    of the Royal Opera House. Originally called the Theatre Royal, it served primarily
    as a playhouse for the first hundred years of its history. In 1734, the first
    ballet was presented. A year later, Handel's first season of operas began. Many
    of his operas and oratorios were specifically written for Covent Garden and had
    their premieres there.

    The current building is the third theatre on the site following disastrous fires
    in 1808 and 1857. The façade, foyer, and auditorium date from 1858, but almost
    every other element of the present complex dates from an extensive reconstruction
    in the 1990s. The Royal Opera House seats 2,256 people and consists of four tiers
    of boxes and balconies and the amphitheatre gallery. The proscenium is 12.20 m
    wide and 14.80 m high. The main auditorium is a Grade 1 listed building as noted
    by Theatres Trust.

    The Globe Theatre was a theatre in London associated with William Shakespeare.
    It was built in 1599 by Shakespeare's playing company, the Lord Chamberlain's
    Men, on land owned by Thomas Brend and inherited by his son, Nicholas Brend and
    grandson Sir Matthew Brend, and was destroyed by fire on 29 June 1613. A second
    Globe Theatre was built on the same site by June 1614 and closed in 1642.

    The Old Vic is a theatre located just south-east of Waterloo Station in London
    on the corner of The Cut and Waterloo Road. Established in 1818 as the Royal Coburg
    Theatre, it was taken over by Emma Cons in 1880 when it was known formally as
    the Royal Victoria Hall. In 1898, a niece of Cons, Lilian Baylis assumed management
    and began a series of Shakespeare productions in 1914. The building was damaged
    in 1940 during air raids and it became a Grade II* listed building in 1951 after
    it reopened.

    It was also the name of a repertory company that was based at the theatre. The
    company formed the core of the National Theatre of Great Britain on its formation
    in 1963, under Laurence Olivier. The National Theatre remained at the Old Vic
    until new premises were constructed on the South Bank, opening in 1976. It underwent
    complete refurbishment in 1985. In 2003 American actor Kevin Spacey was appointed
    as new artistic director of the Old Vic Theatre Company which received considerable
    media attention.

    The Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, commonly known as Drury Lane, is a West End theatre
    in Covent Garden, in the London borough of Westminster. The building faces Catherine
    Street and backs onto Drury Lane. The current building is the most recent in a
    line of four theatres which were built at the same location, the earliest of which
    dates back to 1663, making it the oldest theatre site in London. For its first
    two centuries, Drury Lane could "reasonably have claimed to be London's leading
    theatre". For most of that time, it was one of a handful of patent theatres, granted
    monopoly rights to the production of "legitimate" drama in London.

    The first theatre on the site was built at the behest of Thomas Killigrew in the
    early years of the English Restoration. Initially known as "Theatre Royal in Bridges
    Street", its proprietors hired a number of prominent actors who performed at the
    theatre on a regular basis, including Nell Gwyn and Charles Hart. In 1672 the
    theatre caught fire and Killigrew built a larger theatre on the same plot, designed
    by Sir Christopher Wren; renamed the "Theatre Royal in Drury Lane," it opened
    in 1674. This building lasted nearly 120 years, under the leaderships of Colley
    Cibber, David Garrick and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the last of whom employed
    Joseph Grimaldi as the theatre's resident Clown.

    The Theatre Royal Haymarket is a West End theatre in the Haymarket in the City
    of Westminster which dates back to 1720, making it the third-oldest London playhouse
    still in use. Samuel Foote acquired the lease in 1747, and in 1766 he gained a
    royal patent to play legitimate drama in the summer months. The original building
    was a little further north in the same street. It has been at its current location
    since 1821, when it was redesigned by John Nash. It is a Grade I listed building,
    with a seating capacity of 888. The freehold of the theatre is owned by the Crown
    Estate.

    The Haymarket has been the site of a significant innovation in theatre. In 1873,
    it was the venue for the first scheduled matinée performance, establishing a custom
    soon followed in theatres everywhere. Its managers have included Benjamin Nottingham
    Webster, John Baldwin Buckstone, Squire Bancroft, Cyril Maude, Herbert Beerbohm
    Tree, and John Sleeper Clarke, brother-in-law of John Wilkes Booth, who quit America
    after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Famous actors who débuted at the theatre
    included Robert William Elliston and John Liston.

    The Savoy Theatre is a West End theatre located in the Strand in the City of Westminster,
    London, England. The theatre opened on 10 October 1881 and was built by Richard
    D'Oyly Carte on the site of the old Savoy Palace as a showcase for the popular
    series of comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, which became known as the Savoy
    Operas as a result.

    The theatre was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world,
    to be lit entirely by electricity. In 1889, Richard D'Oyly Carte built the Savoy
    Hotel next to the theatre. For many years, the Savoy was the home of the D'Oyly
    Carte Opera Company, and it was run by the Carte family for over a century. Richard's
    son Rupert D'Oyly Carte rebuilt and modernised the theatre in 1929, and it was
    rebuilt again in 1993 following a fire. It is a Grade II* listed building.

    Apart from The Mikado and other famous Gilbert and Sullivan premières, the theatre
    has hosted such notable premières as the first public performance in England of
    Oscar Wilde's Salome in 1931 and Noël Coward's Blithe Spirit in 1941. In recent
    years it has presented opera, Shakespeare and other non-musical plays, as well
    as musicals, including revivals of Fiddler on the Roof and Carousel, and new shows
    like Never Forget. The original London production of Legally Blonde played from
    December 2009 to April 2012.

    The Noël Coward Theatre, formerly known as the Albery Theatre, is a West End theatre
    on St. Martin's Lane in the City of Westminster, London. It opened on 12 March
    1903 as the New Theatre and was built by Sir Charles Wyndham behind Wyndham's
    Theatre which was completed in 1899. The building was designed by architect W.
    G. R. Sprague with an exterior in the classical style and an interior in the Rococo
    style.

    In 1973 it was renamed the Albery Theatre in tribute to the late Sir Bronson Albery
    who had presided as its manager for many years. Since September 2005, the theatre
    has been owned by Delfont-Mackintosh Ltd. It underwent major refurbishment in
    2006, and was renamed the Noël Coward Theatre when it re-opened for the London
    premiere of Avenue Q on 1 June 2006. Noël Coward, one of Britain's greatest playwrights
    and actors, appeared in his own play, I'll Leave It To You, at the then New Theatre
    in 1920, the first West End production of one of his plays.

    The theatre seats 872 patrons on four levels. The building is now a Grade II Listed
    structure.

    The Gielgud Theatre is a West End theatre, located on Shaftesbury Avenue in the
    City of Westminster, London, at the corner of Rupert Street. The house currently
    has 986 seats on three levels.

    The theatre was designed by W.G.R. Sprague and opened on 27 December 1906 as the
    Hicks Theatre, named after Seymour Hicks, for whom it was built. The first play
    at the theatre was a hit musical called The Beauty of Bath co-written by Hicks.
    Another big success was A Waltz Dream in 1908. In 1909, the American impresario
    Charles Frohman became manager of the theatre and renamed the house the Globe
    Theatre – a name that it retained for 85 years. Call It a Day opened in 1935 and
    ran for 509 performances, a long run for the slow inter-war years. There's a Girl
    in My Soup, opening in 1966, ran for almost three years, a record for the theatre
    that was not surpassed until Daisy Pulls It Off opened in April 1983 to run for
    1,180 performances, the theatre's longest run. In 1987 Peter Shaffer's play Lettice
    and Lovage opened, starring Maggie Smith, and became a hit.

    The Globe's theatre cat, named Beerbohm, became famous enough to receive a front
    page obituary in the theatrical publication, The Stage in 1995. Refurbished in
    1987, the theatre has since presented several Alan Ayckbourn premieres, including
    1990's Man of the Moment, as well as a notable revival of An Ideal Husband in
    1992. During reconstruction of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre on the South Bank,
    in 1994 the theatre was renamed the Gielgud Theatre in honour of John Gielgud.
    Another refurbishment was completed in 2008.
