        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <p>
        We hope that Camdram is easy to use, but sometimes our users have a few
        questions. We've put some answers to our most frequently asked questions
        below. If you have a question that hasn't been answered below, then you
        can <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_contact_us') }}">contact us</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>My name has been misspelt, can you change it?</h3>

        <p>
        Details on Camdram are all added by our users. For most shows it's either
        the producer or director who adds this information: please contact them
        if you want something changing. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>I'm listed under two different names, what do I do?</h3>
        <p>
        That one's easy, just <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_contact_us') }}">let us know</a>
        which entries are duplicates and we'll sort that for you.
        </p>

        <h3>I'm on a society committee, how do I edit the society's page on Camdram?</h3>
        <p>
        Logged-in Camdram users can be given special rights to control a society's
        page, and to authorise submitted show listings that are produced by that society.
        These rights can be passed on from user to user; if you don't have them and you
        think you should, speak to others on your committee or the outgoing committee as
        one or more of them should have the rights.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Can my society be added to Camdram?</h3>
        <p>
            Probably, yes. We're not trying to be exclusive - just 
            <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_contact_us') }}">ask us</a>. As well as being on
            the main list of societies, this will allow people to choose your society when
            creating new shows. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>My event isn't a play, is it suitable for Camdram?</h3>
        <p>
        Camdram was created to support student theatre in Cambridge.  That is still 
        our core focus, but we recognise that there are quite a few related activities that
        can also benefit from what Camdram offers. As a general rule, we're OK with 
        listings for any events that would be of significant interest to somebody
        who's on this site expecting to see Cambridge student theatre events. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        So, student theatre organised by Cambridge societies for performance elsewhere is 
        fine (e.g. tours and theatre festivals), and we welcome non-student societies in the 
        Cambridge area provided students are welcome to participate. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Cambridge-based non-theatre events that need similarly-skilled people involved are also OK.
        For example short films and radio plays still need actors and directors, and usually 
        also a producer whose role is similar to in theatre, plus perhaps technicians 
        and other "backstage" roles with a lot of cross-over from theatre. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Because of the site's history, some things are set up very specifically for standard theatre
        shows, for example the way we ask for "show dates". We hope to adapt Camdram in the future
        to make it easier to list non-shows; for now, if you're listing a non-show event please
        just enter something meaningful in the date fields (for example first screening or broadcast date).
        </p>

        <p>
        If in doubt about whether your event is suitable, please 
        <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_contact_us') }}">contact us</a> to discuss it. 
        </p>

        <h3>Can I buy tickets for your show?</h3>

        <p>
        Camdram is not directly involved with any of the shows we list.
        Tickets can usually be bought from the performance venue. 
        Some of the most commonly used venues for student shows are listed below:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.adctheatre.com/">ADC Theatre</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.corpusplayroom.com/">Corpus Playroom</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.westroad.org/">West Road Concert Hall</a></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3>I've written a fantastic new play, would you like to buy the rights?</h3>
