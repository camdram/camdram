        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
            Our <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_diary') }}">event diary</a> makes it easy to see what’s happening 
            now, in the future, and for more than a decade past.
            </li>

            <li>
            You can easily <a href="{{ path('get_auditions') }}">get involved</a>, thanks to our listings of 
            auditions, production team vacancies, and society funding opportunities.
            </li>

            <li>
            We have information about the city's many <a href="{{ path('get_societies') }}">societies</a> and 
            <a href="{{ path('get_venues') }}">performance spaces</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
            You can use our <a href="http://www.camdram.net/infobase" target="_blank">Infobase</a> to find and share useful information
            about putting on shows.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Camdram has been 100% free since it began in 2004.  We're here for 
        students and staff - from either University and from other schools/colleges.
        </p>

        <p>
        All information comes from users like you, spanning drama, dance, comedy, 
        musicals, and music.  To use Camdram, your event doesn't have to be 
        <em>just</em> for students, so long as they're welcome.
        </p>

        <p>
        The site itself is maintained by volunteers in their spare time.  If you have a question or problem, or you’re 
        interested in helping, 
        <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_contact_us') }}">contact us</a>.
