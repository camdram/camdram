        <h2>Development</h2>

        <p>Camdram is an <a href="http://opensource.org/docs/osd" target="_blank" rel="ext">open source</a> project developed by a team of volunteers
            for the benefit of the Cambridge student theatre community.</p>
        <p>We use <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="ext">Github</a> to co-ordinate our work. On our
            <a href="https://github.com/camdram/camdram" target="_blank" rel="ext">project page</a>
        you can find a copy of the code that runs this site, as well details about bugs that have been submitted and our future roadmap for
        the site.</p>

        <p>If you're a programmer and would like to contribute to camdram, we invite you to 'fork' the
            <a href="https://github.com/camdram/camdram" target="_blank" rel="ext">camdram</a> repository on github. You can then fix any open issue (see
            the list of <a href="https://github.com/camdram/camdram/issues?state=open" target="_blank" rel="ext">open issues</a>), or create a new one.
            Once you've fixed a bug or created some new functionality, you can then submit a 'pull request' to be
            reviewed by the development team.</p>
            
        <p>In order to avoid wasting effort, we recommend you discuss your ideas before carrying out any
        significant development work.  If there's a relevant <a href="https://github.com/camdram/camdram/issues" target="_blank" rel="ext">issue</a> 
        then you can use that.  We also have a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/camdram-dev" target="_blank">Google Group</a>
        for developer discussions and questions - feel free to start a thread there or email <a href="mailto:camdram-dev@googlegroups.com">camdram-dev@googlegroups.com</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>You can also use this group if you're having problems getting your development environment set up, or if you're not sure whether something
          is a bug or a problem with your set-up.
        </p>
        
        <p>We run camdram as a meritocracy: anyone who has a reasonable number of pull requests accepted will be
        given access rights to commit straight to the camdram repository.</p>

        <p>If you don't have programming skills, but you think you've found a bug or have an idea for a cool new feature for camdram,
        you can still <a href="https://github.com/camdram/camdram/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="ext">create a new issue</a> on
        Github, and one of our developers will get back to you.</p>

        <p>Below is a summary of recent development activity on camdram.</p>
